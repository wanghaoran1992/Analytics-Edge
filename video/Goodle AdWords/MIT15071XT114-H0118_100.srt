00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,990


1
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:03,250
In the previous video, we introduced the concept

2
00:00:03,250 --> 00:00:05,700
of price-per-click and click-through-rate.

3
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:07,740
Once we know both of these quantities,

4
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:11,150
we can calculate the average price per display.

5
00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:12,760
This is simply the average amount

6
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:16,309
that an advertiser pays when a user is shown their ad.

7
00:00:16,309 --> 00:00:20,710
We can compute this by multiplying the price-per-click

8
00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:23,250
with the click-through-rate.

9
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:27,330
Let's go through an example to see how this works.

10
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:30,730
Suppose we have 10 users who search for "best LTE network".

11
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:34,290


12
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:37,220
Google decides to display Verizon's ad to all of them.

13
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:42,310


14
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:44,540
We know that the click-through-rate for Verizon

15
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:48,800
and for the "best LTE network" query is 0.2, so only two users

16
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:49,470
click on the ad.

17
00:00:49,470 --> 00:00:54,950


18
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:56,950
Verizon must now pay the price-per-click

19
00:00:56,950 --> 00:00:58,860
for each of these users.

20
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:02,770
Since there were two clicks and each click costs $25,

21
00:01:02,770 --> 00:01:05,390
Verizon must pay a total of $50 to Google.

22
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:07,920


23
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,710
If we consider how much Verizon paid to Google on average,

24
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:14,400
per user, or equivalently how much Verizon paid per display

25
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,200
of the ad, we just divide the total amount

26
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,890
of $50 for the 10 users who saw the ad.

27
00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:23,380
Doing this, we see that the average price per display

28
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:23,985
was $5.

29
00:01:23,985 --> 00:01:27,120


30
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:29,780
We could have obtained this amount in a simpler way.

31
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:32,610
In particular, as we defined in the previous slide,

32
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:35,859
this turns out to be exactly the same as the price-per-click

33
00:01:35,859 --> 00:01:37,400
multiplied by the click-through-rate.

34
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:41,220


35
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:44,460
For our data then, to obtain the average price per display

36
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:46,999
we simply need to multiply the price-per-click table

37
00:01:46,999 --> 00:01:48,790
and the click-through-rate tables together.

38
00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:54,150


39
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:55,710
The last piece of data that we need

40
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:57,650
before we can define our problem is

41
00:01:57,650 --> 00:02:00,450
we need to know how popular the queries are.

42
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:02,790
Obviously, Google does not control how many times

43
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:05,460
a search query will be searched because the users are

44
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:07,240
the ones who submit the queries.

45
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:09,360
However, Google does have an estimate

46
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,310
of the number of times, on average,

47
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:15,340
the query will be requested over a given day.

48
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:17,820
For the example that we have been building so far,

49
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:22,900
let's suppose that we expect to see "4G LTE" 140 times,

50
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:27,951
"largest LTE" 80 times, and "best LTE network" 80 times,

51
00:02:27,951 --> 00:02:28,450
as well.

52
00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:31,780


53
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:34,590
We're now ready to start modeling this problem.

54
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:37,140
The problem that we will consider is this.

55
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:40,980
How many times should Google display each ad for each query,

56
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:43,970
so as to maximize their total revenue?

57
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:45,860
In the next video, we will formulate

58
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:49,090
this as a linear optimization problem.
