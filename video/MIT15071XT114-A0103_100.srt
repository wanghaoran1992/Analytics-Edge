1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,070
For a single route example, our problem

2
00:00:03,070 --> 00:00:06,270
is to find the optimal number of discount seats

3
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:10,200
and regular seats to sell to maximize revenue.

4
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:15,160
We'll assume that the price of regular seats is $617,

5
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:19,580
and the price of discount seats is $238.

6
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:21,850
Also, let's assume that we forecasted

7
00:00:21,850 --> 00:00:25,360
the demand of regular seats to be 100,

8
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:28,810
and the demand of discount seats to be 150.

9
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:33,450
The capacity of our airplane is 166 seats.

10
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:36,270
Let's go ahead and formulate this mathematically

11
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:40,280
as a linear optimization problem.

12
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:43,240
The first step is to decide what our decisions are,

13
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:45,890
or the variables in our model.

14
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:49,650
We need to decide how many regular seats we went to sell.

15
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:51,630
We'll call the number of regular seats

16
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:55,900
we sell R. We also need to decide the number of discount

17
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:57,320
seats we want to sell.

18
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:03,800
We'll call the number of discount seats we sell D.

19
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:05,620
The second step is to decide what

20
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:08,220
our objective, or our goal, is.

21
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:11,620
In this case, it's to maximize the total revenue

22
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:13,500
to the airline.

23
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,450
The revenue from each type of seat

24
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:17,860
is equal to the number of that type of seat

25
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:21,020
sold times the seat price.

26
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:23,390
In the case of regular seats, this

27
00:01:23,390 --> 00:01:30,230
is $617 times R, the number of regular seats we sell.

28
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:35,740
And for discount seats, this is $230 times D,

29
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:38,320
the number of discount seats we sell.

30
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:41,550
We sum these together to get the total revenue,

31
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:44,680
and our objective is to maximize this sum.

32
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:47,480


33
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:50,880
The third step is to define the constraints, or limits,

34
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,640
of our decisions.

35
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:56,470
One constraint is that American Airlines can't sell more seats

36
00:01:56,470 --> 00:02:00,970
than the aircraft capacity, which is 166 seats.

37
00:02:00,970 --> 00:02:06,170
So the total number of seats sold, R + D has to be less than

38
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:10,600
or equal to the capacity of 166.

39
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:13,910
Additionally, American Airlines shouldn't sell more seats

40
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:16,590
than the demand for each type of seat.

41
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:21,070
So the regular seats, R, shouldn't exceed 100.

42
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:24,320
So R should be less than or equal to 100.

43
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:28,000
And the discount seats, D, can't exceed 150.

44
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,240
So D should be less than or equal to 150.

45
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:36,090
The final step is to make sure our variables are

46
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:38,100
taking reasonable values.

47
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:40,050
In this case, it wouldn't make sense

48
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:42,300
to sell a negative number of seats,

49
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:46,060
so we need to make sure that both R and D are

50
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:47,600
greater than or equal to 0.

51
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:51,420


52
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:55,950
So our entire problem is to maximize total airline revenue,

53
00:02:55,950 --> 00:02:58,980
subject to the constraints that seats sold can't exceed

54
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:02,560
capacity, seats sold can't exceed demand,

55
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:05,220
and the seats sold can't be negative.

56
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:11,250
Mathematically, this can be written as maximize 617*R +

57
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:16,700
238*D, the total revenue, subject to the constraints:

58
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:21,650
R + D is less than or equal to 166, the capacity constraint;

59
00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:25,720
R less than or equal to 100, and D less than or equal to 150,

60
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:27,770
which are the demand constraints;

61
00:03:27,770 --> 00:03:31,410
and R and D are both greater than or equal to 0.

62
00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:34,910
This is called a linear optimization problem.

63
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:38,500
In the next video, we'll see how to solve this problem using

64
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,762
the software, LibreOffice.

65
00:03:40,762 --> 00:03:41,262
