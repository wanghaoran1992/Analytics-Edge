1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:04,780
Now, let's take a look at a full example of a case.

2
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:08,160
This is a head and neck example, and the CT scans

3
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:09,980
are shown on the right.

4
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:16,280
There are a total of 132,878 voxels.

5
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:23,680
The target, or tumor, has 9,777 voxels.

6
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:25,680
There are five critical structures

7
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:31,400
that we want to minimize the dose to-- the spinal cord,

8
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:36,540
the brain, the brain stem, the parotid glands,

9
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:39,350
and the mandible or jaw.

10
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:42,130
We're using five beams, and each beam

11
00:00:42,130 --> 00:00:45,110
is composed of about 60 beamlets.

12
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:49,990
In total, there are 328 beamlets.

13
00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:53,660
In this example, we want the dose to the whole tumor

14
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:57,310
to be between 70 and 77 gray.

15
00:00:57,310 --> 00:01:01,400
The spinal cord dose should be no more than 45 gray,

16
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:05,200
since significant damage to any voxel in the spinal cord

17
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:08,100
will result in loss of function.

18
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:12,240
The brain stem dose should be no more than 54 gray,

19
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:16,150
and the mandible dose should be no more than 70 gray.

20
00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:21,160
The average parotid gland dose should be at most 26 gray.

21
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:22,940
This constraint is a little different,

22
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:25,960
since the parotid gland is a parallel structure.

23
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:28,920
Significant damage to any one voxel

24
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:33,730
does not jeopardize function of the entire organ.

25
00:01:33,730 --> 00:01:36,700
So what is our optimization problem now?

26
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:41,080
Again, our decisions are the intensities of the beamlets.

27
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:46,100
Our objective is to minimize the total dose to healthy tissue.

28
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:49,260
Our constraints are limits on the tumor dose

29
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:53,690
and upper bounds for the spinal cord, brain stem, and mandible.

30
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:57,420
We also have a constraint to limit the average parotid dose

31
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:59,470
to 26 gray.

32
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:03,220
Lastly, all of our intensities, or decision variables,

33
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:05,640
should be non-negative.

34
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:08,330
We solved this optimization problem,

35
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:10,800
and this plot shows the results.

36
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,270
On the x-axis is the dose, in gray, and on

37
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:17,010
the y-axis is the fraction of voxels

38
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:20,070
that received that dose or higher.

39
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:23,730
Each line corresponds to a different structure.

40
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:28,080
We can see that for the tumor, which is shown as the red line,

41
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:34,270
100% of the voxels get a dose of 70 gray, and 0% of the voxels

42
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:37,460
get a dose of more than 77 gray.

43
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:40,410
This is what our constraint specified.

44
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:42,400
While none of the critical structures

45
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,840
are getting very high doses, it looks

46
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:47,710
like the mandible, which is shown as the blue line,

47
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:51,420
is receiving the highest dose of the healthy organs.

48
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:54,950
In the next video, we'll explore different solutions

49
00:02:54,950 --> 00:02:58,200
and the shadow prices of our constraints.
