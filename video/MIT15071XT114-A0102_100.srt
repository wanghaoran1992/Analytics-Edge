1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,960
To illustrate how linear optimization works in revenue

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:05,290
management, let us consider a simple example --

3
00:00:05,290 --> 00:00:08,620
a flight from New York to Los Angeles.

4
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:11,980
In this flight, there are two types of economy fares,

5
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:16,930
Early Bird fares that cost $238, and Last Minute fares

6
00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:20,170
that cost $617.

7
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:23,320
In this flight, a Boeing 757 is used

8
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:27,720
that has 166 economy seats.

9
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:30,300
Demand for these prices has been forecasted

10
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:33,390
using analytics tools, looking at historical data

11
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:35,220
and incorporating models like time

12
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:37,520
series or linear regression.

13
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:40,920
Clearly, forecasts have errors, and therefore, we

14
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:44,200
need to assess the sensitivity of our decisions

15
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:45,980
to these errors.

16
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:48,060
To illustrate the use of linear optimization,

17
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:50,475
we assume that demand has already been forecasted.

18
00:00:50,475 --> 00:00:53,220


19
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:56,650
We'll illustrate how our decisions on how many discount

20
00:00:56,650 --> 00:01:02,860
seats to sell vary as the demand forecasts vary.

21
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:05,340
If the demand for regular seats is

22
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:10,500
50, and for discounted fares is 150,

23
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:15,250
and the capacity is 166 seats, then the optimal allocation

24
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:19,800
is going to be to sell the 50 seats to satisfy

25
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:24,610
the regular demand, and then we allocate the remaining 116

26
00:01:24,610 --> 00:01:28,770
seats to the discounted fare class.

27
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:31,700
If the regular demand increases to 100 seats,

28
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:37,080
then we allocate these 100 seats to these customers, and only

29
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:40,910
66 seats to discounted fare customers.

30
00:01:40,910 --> 00:01:44,710
Finally, if the regular demand increases to 200,

31
00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:49,130
then we allocate all of our capacity, 166 seats,

32
00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:51,260
to these customers.

33
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:54,200
While this seems simple, what happens

34
00:01:54,200 --> 00:02:00,830
if we have 100 flights with connections in tens of fares?

35
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:04,480
We'll next see how to formulate the problem mathematically

36
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:08,920
and solve it in a systematic way, using linear optimization.
