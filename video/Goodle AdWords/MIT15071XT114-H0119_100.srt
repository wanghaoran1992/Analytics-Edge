00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,960


1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:02,620
So let's begin modeling this problem

2
00:00:02,620 --> 00:00:05,460
as a linear optimization problem.

3
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:08,150
In terms of the framework that we have seen in the lectures,

4
00:00:08,150 --> 00:00:11,960
our objective is to maximize the revenue to Google.

5
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:15,430
Our decision is for each advertiser and each query

6
00:00:15,430 --> 00:00:18,910
to decide the number of times that advertiser's ad will

7
00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:21,940
be displayed for that query.

8
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:23,970
Our constraints are of two types.

9
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:26,800
Our first constraint is that the average amount paid by each

10
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:29,920
advertiser, based on the number of times Google displays

11
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:34,580
their ad for each query, cannot exceed the budget of that

12
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:36,430
advertiser.

13
00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:38,880
Our second constraint is that the total number of ads we

14
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:42,510
display for a query cannot exceed our estimate

15
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:45,570
of the number of requests that we expect to see for that

16
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:47,990
query.

17
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:50,240
Let's quickly review our problem data.

18
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:52,570
We have the average price per display

19
00:00:52,570 --> 00:00:55,700
for each advertiser and each query.

20
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:58,720
We have the budget of each advertiser.

21
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:01,150
And we have estimates of the number

22
00:01:01,150 --> 00:01:03,830
of requests for each query.

23
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:05,580
So let's now think about how to model

24
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:08,490
all the pieces of our problem.

25
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:11,700
First, how should we define our decision variables?

26
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:15,240
Well, we should define them for each advertiser and each query.

27
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:17,940
So for example, one of our decision variables

28
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:19,070
will be x_A1.

29
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:22,510


30
00:01:22,510 --> 00:01:24,680
x_A1 is the number of times we will

31
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:28,520
display AT&T's ad for query 1.

32
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:34,740
Similarly, we can define x_A2 and x_A3.

33
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:37,960
These are the numbers of times that we will display AT&T's ad

34
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:40,700
for queries 2 and 3, respectively.

35
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:43,040
Now, of course, we have three different advertisers,

36
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:48,530
so we will have variables x_T1, x_T2, and x_T3.

37
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:51,120


38
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:53,080
These variables represent the number of times

39
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:56,580
that we display T-Mobile's ad for queries 1, 2,

40
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:58,390
and 3, respectively.

41
00:01:58,390 --> 00:02:00,850
And, of course, our last advertiser's Verizon.

42
00:02:00,850 --> 00:02:07,973
So we will have variables x_V1, x_V2, and x_V3, which

43
00:02:07,973 --> 00:02:09,639
are the numbers of times that we display

44
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:13,320
Verizon's ad for queries 1, 2, and 3, respectively.

45
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:15,886


46
00:02:15,886 --> 00:02:17,760
Now, how do we compute the revenue to Google,

47
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,260
which is our objective?

48
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:21,820
Well, we know the average price per display,

49
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:24,850
and our decision variables tell us exactly how many times

50
00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:27,420
we'll display each ad for each query.

51
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:30,680
So all we need to do is we need to multiply each decision

52
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:33,950
variable with its corresponding average price per display

53
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:35,610
and add them all up.

54
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:52,550
If we did this, we would have 0.5*x_A1 + 0.5*x_A2 + 1.6*x_A3

55
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:54,207
+ 1*x_T1.

56
00:02:54,207 --> 00:02:57,010


57
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:58,220
And we can continue this.

58
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:03,480
And the last term in our sum will be 5*x_V3.

59
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:06,850


60
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:10,110
To get the constraints, we use a similar process.

61
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:12,850
For instance, to get how much AT&T pays,

62
00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:16,100
we multiply the AT&T variables by their average prices

63
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:18,210
per display and add them up.

64
00:03:18,210 --> 00:03:28,406
So we'd get 0.5*x_A1 + 0.5*x_A2 + 1.6*x_A3.

65
00:03:28,406 --> 00:03:32,510


66
00:03:32,510 --> 00:03:34,510
Now, one of our constraints, as you will recall,

67
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:39,410
is that this cannot exceed AT&T's budget, which is $170.

68
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:45,170
So our model would have the constraint 0.5*x_A1 + 0.5*x_A2

69
00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:53,580
+ 1.6*x_A3, is less than 170.

70
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:56,330
We can repeat this to get the same kind of budget constraint

71
00:03:56,330 --> 00:03:58,890
for T-Mobile and Verizon.

72
00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:02,160
Now, to get the number of times query 2 is used,

73
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:05,470
we add up the decision variables corresponding to query 2.

74
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:08,900
So we have x_A2, the number of times

75
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:11,880
AT&T is paired with query 2.

76
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:15,110
We have x_T2, which is the number of times

77
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:19,700
T-Mobile is paired with query 2, and x_V2,

78
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:23,660
which is the number of times Verizon is paired with query 2.

79
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:25,920
Now, one of our constraints is that this cannot exceed

80
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:29,310
the estimated number of requests for query 2, which is 80.

81
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:35,150
So our model would have the constraint x_A2 + x_T2 + x_V2

82
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:38,530
all less than 80.

83
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:40,560
We can do this for the other queries.

84
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,350
So we can do this for query 1 and query 3.

85
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:45,410
And this is all that we really need.

86
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:48,290
So now, let's take this problem to LibreOffice

87
00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:50,650
and actually solve it.
