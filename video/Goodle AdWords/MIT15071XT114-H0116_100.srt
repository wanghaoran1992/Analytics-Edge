1
00:00:00,499 --> 00:00:03,590
In this recitation, we'll be going over the basic steps

2
00:00:03,590 --> 00:00:07,420
in building, solving, and analyzing a linear optimization

3
00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:08,920
model.

4
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:11,380
The problem we will use to demonstrate this

5
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:15,005
comes from Google AdWords, which is the advertising system used

6
00:00:15,005 --> 00:00:16,720
by Google.

7
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:19,830
Let's begin by talking a little bit about Google.

8
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:22,740
As you may know, Google is a major company in the United

9
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:25,740
States that provides products and services related

10
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:27,330
to the internet.

11
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:29,280
Google's official mission statement

12
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:31,350
is to organize the world's information,

13
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:35,350
and to make it universally accessible and useful.

14
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:38,480
Although Google today develops a variety of products

15
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,590
that includes things such as the Android operating

16
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:44,020
system, the Google Glass wearable computer, and even

17
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:47,390
self-driving cars, Google became famous--

18
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:50,250
and is still most widely known-- for its search engine, which

19
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:55,491
can be found at www.google.com.

20
00:00:55,491 --> 00:00:58,980
The search engine lets the user enter a query.

21
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:00,790
Google then searches through the web pages

22
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:03,700
accessible on the internet, to return links to websites

23
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:07,120
that best fit the search query.

24
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:09,370
Now, how did Google come about?

25
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:11,650
Well, the idea of Google originated

26
00:01:11,650 --> 00:01:13,800
as a research project of two people--

27
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:16,770
Sergey Brin and Larry Page.

28
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:19,030
This was in 1996, while they were still

29
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:22,030
graduate students at Stanford University.

30
00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:24,910
Their idea, in a nut shell, was to measure the importance

31
00:01:24,910 --> 00:01:27,120
of a web page to a particular query,

32
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:29,920
not just by measuring how much that query occurs in that web

33
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:33,610
page, but also by considering the links to that web page

34
00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:35,626
from other web pages.

35
00:01:35,626 --> 00:01:37,250
They quickly found that this idea could

36
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:39,080
form the core of a search engine,

37
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:41,010
and they found that the search engine actually

38
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:42,700
worked quite well.

39
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:44,560
They eventually named it Google.

40
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:48,830
And in 1998, they incorporated Google as a company.

41
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:51,380
In the same year, they received their first funding.

42
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:55,360
At the time, they had a database of 60 million web pages.

43
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:58,000
Six years later, Google's initial public offering

44
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,090
took place, and Google became a publicly traded company.

45
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:04,020
After going public, Google has continued

46
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:06,880
to grow at an immense pace, acquiring other internet

47
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,979
companies like YouTube in 2007.

48
00:02:09,979 --> 00:02:13,800
In 2013, Google's traffic reached more than a billion

49
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,850
unique monthly visitors.

50
00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:18,610
Today, more than two-thirds of all the searches

51
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:22,890
done on the internet are powered by Google's search engine.

52
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:26,240
Now, you may be rather surprised to hear that Google does not

53
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:29,400
actually make any money directly from its search engine.

54
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:33,930
In fact, Google's search engine is free for anyone to use.

55
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:36,920
So then, how does Google make money?

56
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:41,030
And the answer is -- through online advertising.

57
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:45,790
Basically, Google sells space on its web pages-- in particular,

58
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:49,120
results of its search queries-- to outside companies.

59
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,660
These companies can then place advertisements, or ads,

60
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:53,090
on these spaces.

61
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:55,940
Let's take a look at a concrete example.

62
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:59,540
So here we have a screen shot of the results of a Google search.

63
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:02,260
The query here was "nine inch nails tickets".

64
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:04,680
Nine Inch Nails-- if you're not familiar with it--

65
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,710
is a critically acclaimed industrial rock band

66
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:10,760
from the United States, that recently toured North America.

67
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:17,860
On this page, there are only two search results-- here and here.

68
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:19,910
The first is a link to Ticketmaster,

69
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:22,590
which is a company that sells concert tickets.

70
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:25,280
The second is to the tour page of Nine Inch Nails'

71
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,990
official website.

72
00:03:26,990 --> 00:03:32,130
All the remaining links on this web page are ads.

73
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:33,820
In this case, these are mostly links

74
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:37,530
to other third-party companies that resell tickets.

75
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:40,930
Now, you may be asking, why do companies

76
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:42,560
advertise with Google?

77
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,480
Well, there are several reasons.

78
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,860
As you saw a few slides back, Google

79
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:49,260
receives a lot of internet traffic, as a lot of users

80
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:50,980
conduct searches on Google.

81
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:52,550
So an ad placed on Google could be

82
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:55,630
seen by a very large number of users.

83
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:58,960
At the same time, Google's web pages-- and the ads in them--

84
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:02,830
are formatted in a very clean, visually appealing way.

85
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:05,720
Lastly, companies that advertise with Google

86
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:08,930
can select which queries their ads will be displayed for.

87
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:11,350
This is a very useful feature, because a company can then

88
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:13,420
target specific customers that they

89
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:15,360
think are likely to buy their product,

90
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,540
or to use their service.

91
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:21,649
Google's online advertising system is known as AdWords

92
00:04:21,649 --> 00:04:24,440
and is responsible for more than 97%

93
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:27,820
percent of Google's revenues.

94
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:30,190
In the next video, we'll go into more detail

95
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:33,410
about the components of the AdWords system.
