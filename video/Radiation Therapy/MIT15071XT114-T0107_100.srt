1
00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:04,240
In this lecture, we'll discuss how linear optimization

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:08,320
is used to design radiation therapy treatments for cancer

3
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:10,560
patients.

4
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:12,480
Cancer is the second leading cause

5
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:16,680
of death in the United States, second only to heart disease.

6
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:23,690
There were an estimated 570,000 deaths in 2013 due to cancer.

7
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:28,110
Additionally, over 1.6 million new cases of cancer

8
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:32,560
will be diagnosed in the United States in 2013.

9
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:35,580
These trends are also seen throughout the world.

10
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:38,670
Worldwide, cancer is a leading cause of death,

11
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:43,570
with 8.2 million deaths in 2012.

12
00:00:43,570 --> 00:00:46,690
Cancer can be treated using radiation therapy,

13
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:48,960
where beams of high-energy photons

14
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:52,930
are fired into the patient to kill cancerous cells.

15
00:00:52,930 --> 00:00:55,060
This is a very common form of treatment

16
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:58,510
for many types of cancers, and in the United States,

17
00:00:58,510 --> 00:01:00,790
about half of all cancer patients

18
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:05,319
undergo some form of radiation therapy.

19
00:01:05,319 --> 00:01:10,630
Radiation therapy has a history going back to the late 1800s.

20
00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:15,590
X-rays were discovered by Wilhelm Rontgen in 1895,

21
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:20,110
who was later awarded the first Nobel Prize in Physics.

22
00:01:20,110 --> 00:01:22,550
Shortly after the discovery, X-rays

23
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:26,130
started being used to treat skin cancers.

24
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:30,290
This image shows an x-ray of Rontgen's wife's hand.

25
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:32,330
You can see the bones in her hand

26
00:01:32,330 --> 00:01:35,610
as well as her wedding ring on her finger.

27
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:39,090
A few years later in 1898, radium

28
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:42,710
was discovered by Marie and Pierre Curie.

29
00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:47,480
They won the Nobel Prize for this discovery in 1911.

30
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:50,720
Radium started being used to treat cancer, as well

31
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:51,485
as other diseases.

32
00:01:51,485 --> 00:01:54,210


33
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:58,760
Later in the 1900s, the first radiation delivery machines,

34
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:02,200
called linear accelerators, were developed.

35
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:08,930
Then computed tomography, or CT scans, were invented in 1971.

36
00:02:08,930 --> 00:02:11,520
These discoveries led to the invention

37
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:16,510
of Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy, or IMRT,

38
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:20,190
in the early 1980s.

39
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:22,910
The invention of IMRT significantly

40
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:25,780
improved the ability of radiation therapy

41
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:28,290
to target cancerous cells.

42
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:31,020
To reach the tumor, radiation passes

43
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:33,760
through healthy tissue and therefore damages

44
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:37,370
both healthy and cancerous tissue.

45
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:39,280
This damage to healthy tissue can

46
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,810
lead to undesirable side effects that

47
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:44,520
reduce post-treatment quality of life.

48
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:47,980
For example, blistering and burning of skin

49
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:52,160
can occur because of the damage to healthy skin cells.

50
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,300
For this reason, we want the dose

51
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:57,140
to fit the tumor as closely as possible

52
00:02:57,140 --> 00:02:59,810
to reduce the dose to healthy tissue.

53
00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:02,700
This became possible with the invention of IMRT.

54
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:05,430


55
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:11,670
In IMRT, the intensity profile of each beam is non-uniform.

56
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:16,360
Before IMRT, each beam had to have the same intensity,

57
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:19,460
so the tumor could not be targeted very well.

58
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:23,060
But by using non-uniform intensity profiles,

59
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:26,190
the radiation dose can better fit the tumor.

60
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:28,930
Let's see what this looks like.

61
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:32,620
In this image, we have a person's body outlined

62
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:36,010
in black, and then the target, or tumor,

63
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:39,750
and two critical structures also outlined.

64
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:43,400
We would like to maximize the radiation to the target,

65
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:46,110
while minimizing the dose to healthy tissue,

66
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:49,230
and especially to the critical structures.

67
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:51,820
Using traditional radiation therapy,

68
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:54,690
each of the three beams has the same intensity

69
00:03:54,690 --> 00:03:58,010
throughout the beam.

70
00:03:58,010 --> 00:04:01,030
So to deliver enough radiation to the tumor,

71
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:04,870
we also have to deliver a significant amount of radiation

72
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:09,970
to the critical structures and to other healthy tissue.

73
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:13,830
But by using IMRT, we can change the intensity

74
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:17,160
throughout each beam to make it non-uniform.

75
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,829
Some pieces of the beam will have

76
00:04:18,829 --> 00:04:21,620
a higher intensity than others.

77
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:24,740
This allows us to deliver the necessary amount of radiation

78
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:28,120
to the tumor, while minimizing the total radiation

79
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:31,680
to healthy tissue, and thus, the critical structures

80
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:35,440
get significantly less radiation.

81
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:39,450
Each of the pieces of the beam is referred to as a beamlet.

82
00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:42,390
So in IMRT, we decide the intensity

83
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:44,410
of each of the beamlets so that we

84
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:46,730
can target the tumor with radiation

85
00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:51,170
while minimizing the radiation to healthy tissue.

86
00:04:51,170 --> 00:04:53,820
So in designing an IMRT treatment,

87
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:56,950
the fundamental problem is -- how should the beamlet

88
00:04:56,950 --> 00:05:00,850
intensities be selected to deliver a therapeutic dose

89
00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:05,670
to the tumor and to minimize damage to healthy tissue?

90
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:08,440
This is the problem that we'll address in this lecture,

91
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:10,576
using linear optimization.

92
00:05:10,576 --> 00:05:11,076
