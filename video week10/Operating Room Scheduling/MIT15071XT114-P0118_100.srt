Hi, this is Angie.

2
00:00:01,880 --> 00:00:03,520
I'll be giving the recitation this week

3
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:05,486
on integer optimization.

4
00:00:05,486 --> 00:00:06,860
In the sports scheduling lecture,

5
00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:09,290
we saw how integer optimization was a great way

6
00:00:09,290 --> 00:00:11,160
to design an optimal schedule.

7
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:13,620
Today, we'll see how Mount Sinai Hospital in Toronto

8
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:16,950
uses integer optimization to schedule their operating rooms.

9
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:18,820
Let's get started.

00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:19,776
