00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,500


1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,490
In this video, we'll design the optimization problem

2
00:00:03,490 --> 00:00:07,520
that the operating room manager would need to solve.

3
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:13,090
The decision to be made is how many operating rooms

4
00:00:13,090 --> 00:00:17,760
to assign each department on each day.

5
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:20,120
This means that we need to define integer decision

6
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:22,818
variables x_jk.

7
00:00:22,818 --> 00:00:26,430
x_jk will represent the number of operating rooms

8
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:30,040
department j is allocated on day k.

9
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:35,780
So here j can take values such as ophthalmology, gynecology,

10
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:38,460
general surgery, and so on.

11
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:42,010
Whereas k would take values like Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday,

12
00:00:42,010 --> 00:00:45,020
and so on.

13
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:46,650
The objective of this problem will

14
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:49,930
be to maximize the percent of target allocation hours

15
00:00:49,930 --> 00:00:52,890
that each department is actually allocated.

16
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:57,830
So if target allocation hours are t_j for department j,

17
00:00:57,830 --> 00:01:04,685
then we want to maximize the sum of 8*x_jk divided by t_j over

18
00:01:04,685 --> 00:01:07,660
all departments and days of the week.

19
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:10,050
Let's break this down.

20
00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:13,070
For example, if otolaryngology has

21
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:16,640
a target of 37.3 hours per week--

22
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:21,760
that means t_j equals to 37.3-- and we allocate them

23
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:25,930
4 operating rooms, then their percent of target allocation

24
00:01:25,930 --> 00:01:29,160
hours is equal to 8 times 4, that

25
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:33,230
is, they got 32 hours, divided by the 37.3 hours

26
00:01:33,230 --> 00:01:34,560
they asked for.

27
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,230
So they got 85.8% of what they wanted.

28
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:41,700


29
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:44,150
And we try to maximize this percentage value

30
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:46,150
for every department.

31
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:48,450
So that's why we sum over all departments

32
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:49,640
and all days of the week.

33
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:54,560


34
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:57,880
Let's continue on to the constraints.

35
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:01,390
Remember that Mount Sinai has 10 operating rooms.

36
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:03,380
Therefore, at most 10 operating rooms

37
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:07,080
can be assigned on any given day.

38
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:10,220
Also, the number of operating rooms allocated to a department

39
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:13,440
on a given day cannot exceed the number of surgery teams that

40
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,860
the department has available that day.

41
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:20,420
And as we said before, we must meet department daily minimums

42
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:25,060
and maximums as well as weekly minimums and maximums.

43
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:28,160
Let's turn these constraints into math.

44
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:31,510
So the first constraint is that at most 10 operating rooms

45
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:34,540
can be assigned on any given day.

46
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:37,100
Let's consider Monday for example.

47
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:40,220
That means that x for ophthalmology

48
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:43,090
on Monday plus x for gynecology on Monday

49
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:45,010
plus x for oral surgery on Monday

50
00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:48,000
plus x for otolaryngology on Monday

51
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,850
plus x for general surgery on Monday

52
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:55,114
must add up to something less than or equal to 10.

53
00:02:55,114 --> 00:02:56,530
We would have a similar constraint

54
00:02:56,530 --> 00:03:00,700
for Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday.

55
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:03,710
The next set of constraints is that the number of operating

56
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:07,500
rooms allocated to a department on a given day cannot exceed

57
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:12,610
the number of surgery teams that are available that day.

58
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:18,930
So for example, for gynecology on Friday

59
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:21,080
there are 3 teams available.

60
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:26,750
That means that x gynecology Friday must be between 0 and 3.

61
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:31,540
For oral surgery on Wednesday it must be between 0 and 0

62
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:34,780
because the oral surgeon is only in on Tuesdays and Thursdays.

63
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:37,700


64
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:39,530
The next set of constraints is that we

65
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:44,390
must meet department daily minimums and maximums.

66
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:48,060
For example, the general surgery department on Tuesday

67
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:51,570
requires between 0 and 6 operating rooms.

68
00:03:51,570 --> 00:03:54,160
We would have a similar constraint for every department

69
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:56,910
and for every day of the week.

70
00:03:56,910 --> 00:04:00,810
We also need to meet department weekly minimums and maximums.

71
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:04,150
So for example, the ophthalmology department

72
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:07,970
has a minimum of 3 and a maximum of 6 operating rooms

73
00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:10,960
that it needs in any given week.
