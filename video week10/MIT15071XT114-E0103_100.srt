00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,770


1
00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:03,050
In this video, we'll solve our sports

2
00:00:03,050 --> 00:00:06,250
scheduling problem in LibreOffice.

3
00:00:06,250 --> 00:00:10,500
We can use the solver to solve integer optimization problems

4
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:15,140
using the same process as for linear optimization problems.

5
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:17,010
The only difference is that we need

6
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:19,820
to add extra constraints to define variables

7
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:22,640
as integer or binary.

8
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:25,460
Let's go ahead and solve our small tournament scheduling

9
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:26,830
problem.

10
00:00:26,830 --> 00:00:29,630
In LibreOffice, or in the spreadsheet software

11
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:32,225
you're using, go ahead and open the spreadsheet

12
00:00:32,225 --> 00:00:33,100
SportsScheduling.ods.

13
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:35,940


14
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:37,740
At the top of the spreadsheet, I've

15
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:41,070
created a spot for our decision variables.

16
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:44,150
We have a decision variable for each week,

17
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:47,490
weeks one through four, and for each team pair:

18
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:53,410
A and B, A and C, A and D, B and C, B and D,

19
00:00:53,410 --> 00:00:57,730
and C and D. This gives us a total of 24 decision

20
00:00:57,730 --> 00:01:00,770
variables highlighted in yellow.

21
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:02,790
Below the decision variables, there's

22
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:06,570
a spot for our objective, highlighted in blue.

23
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:10,430
Let's go ahead and construct our objective.

24
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:13,690
Start by typing an equals sign, and then we

25
00:01:13,690 --> 00:01:18,490
want it to be equal to 1 times the decision variable for A

26
00:01:18,490 --> 00:01:23,890
and B in week 1, plus 2 times the decision variable for A

27
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:30,995
and B in week 2, plus 4 times the decision variable for A

28
00:01:30,995 --> 00:01:35,220
and B in week 3, plus 8 times the decision

29
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:37,880
variable for A and B in week 4.

30
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:41,170
Now we want to repeat this for teams C and D.

31
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:46,320
So now we have 1 times the decision variable for C and D

32
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:51,520
in week 1, plus 2 times the decision variable for C and D

33
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:57,170
in week 2, plus 4 times the decision variable for C and D

34
00:01:57,170 --> 00:02:02,740
in week 3, plus 8 times the decision variable for C and D

35
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:04,440
in week 4.

36
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:06,420
Go ahead and hit Enter.

37
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:08,580
Our objective has value 0 for now

38
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:12,370
because we haven't filled in our decision variables yet.

39
00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:15,280
Now, let's construct our constraints.

40
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:19,690
The first constraint is teams A and B should play twice.

41
00:02:19,690 --> 00:02:23,970
So our left hand side should be equal to the sum-- we'll

42
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:26,980
use the sum function here, which just adds up

43
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:29,200
everything inside the parentheses.

44
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:32,850
So type =sum, and then in parentheses,

45
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:37,230
select the four A and B decision variables.

46
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:39,990
The sign should be equals and the right hand side

47
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:41,580
should be 2.

48
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:44,810
Now let's just repeat this for teams C and D.

49
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:49,050
So the left hand side is the sum of the C and D decision

50
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:55,480
variables, the sign is equals, and the right hand side is 2.

51
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:58,105
Now we want to add the constraint that teams A

52
00:02:58,105 --> 00:03:03,350
and C should play once, so this left hand side is very similar.

53
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:08,360
It should be the sum of the A and C decision variables,

54
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:11,390
the sign should be equals, and the right hand side here

55
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:13,490
should be 1.

56
00:03:13,490 --> 00:03:16,550
Now let's repeat this for teams A and D.

57
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:21,650
The left hand side is the sum of the A and D decision variables,

58
00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:25,660
the sign is equals, and the right hand side is 1.

59
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:28,600
We'll repeat it again for teams B and C.

60
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:32,150
So the left hand side is the sum of the B and C decision

61
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:37,440
variables, the sign is equals, and the right hand side is 1.

62
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,410
The last of this type of constraint

63
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:42,760
is that teams B and D should play once,

64
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:46,430
so the left hand side is the sum of the B and D decision

65
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:52,170
variables, the sign is equals, and the right hand side is 1.

66
00:03:52,170 --> 00:03:53,880
Now we want to add the constraints

67
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:57,500
that each team should only play once in each week.

68
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:01,780
So the first is that team A should play once in week one.

69
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:05,740
So the left hand side should be the sum of all of the decision

70
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:08,800
variables where A plays in week one.

71
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:13,540
So this should be equal to A playing B in week one,

72
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:20,310
plus A playing C in week one, plus A playing D in week one.

73
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:24,770
The sign is equals, and the right hand side is again 1.

74
00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:26,906
Now let's repeat this for week two.

75
00:04:26,906 --> 00:04:30,720
So the left hand side is equal to A playing B in week two,

76
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:37,310
plus A playing C in week two, plus A playing D in week two.

77
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:41,360
The sign is equals and the right hand side is 1.

78
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,930
Now let's repeat this for weeks three and four.

79
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:46,870
So for week three, the left hand side

80
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:52,270
is just equal to the variables of A playing with week three:

81
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:57,920
A and B, A and C, A and D. The sign is equals

82
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:00,400
and the right hand side is 1.

83
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,010
For week four, the left hand side

84
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:08,690
is just the A variables in week four, A and B, A and C,

85
00:05:08,690 --> 00:05:12,330
and A and D. The sign should be equals

86
00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:15,010
and the right hand side is 1.

87
00:05:15,010 --> 00:05:18,400
I went ahead and filled in the rest of the constraints for you

88
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:22,390
since they're just repeating the same thing for team B,

89
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:26,000
team C, and team D.

90
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,600
Now we're ready to solve our problem.

91
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:34,070
So let's go to the "Tools" menu and select "Solver".

92
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:38,010
In the Solver window, let's first pick our target cell.

93
00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:41,550
So with the cursor in the "Target cell" box,

94
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:43,760
go ahead and select the objective cell,

95
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,600
or the blue cell.

96
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,820
Make sure that "Maximum" is selected,

97
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:51,250
since we're trying to maximize preferences.

98
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:55,100
Then, with the cursor in the "By changing cells" box,

99
00:05:55,100 --> 00:06:00,190
go ahead and select all 24 decision variables.

100
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:02,650
Now, let's add in our constraints.

101
00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:05,630
Since all of our constraints have an equals sign,

102
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:08,100
we can add them all in together.

103
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:10,740
So in the first Cell Reference box,

104
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:13,386
go ahead and select all of the left hand sides.

105
00:06:13,386 --> 00:06:19,560


106
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:24,150
In the Operator box, select equals.

107
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:28,005
Then, in the Value box, select all of the right hand sides.

108
00:06:28,005 --> 00:06:36,590


109
00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:39,290
Since this is an integer optimization problem,

110
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:42,710
there's one more thing we need to do in the constraint area.

111
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:45,300
In the Cell Reference box, go ahead

112
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:47,440
and select all of the decision variables.

113
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:51,530


114
00:06:51,530 --> 00:06:55,720
Then, in the operator pull down menu, select Binary.

115
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:58,850
This will make all of our decision variables binary.

116
00:06:58,850 --> 00:07:02,420
We don't need to put anything in the Value column.

117
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:05,460
The last thing we need to do is in Options,

118
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:10,640
make sure that we're using the linear solver, and click OK.

119
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:14,000
Now, go ahead and hit Solve.

120
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,140
The solving results says: solving successfully

121
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:18,400
finished, result 24.

122
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:21,130
Go ahead and pick Keep Result, and now let's

123
00:07:21,130 --> 00:07:22,900
look at our solution.

124
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:27,820
We can see that teams A and B and teams C and D

125
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:30,800
both play during weeks 3 and 4.

126
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:34,860
This makes sense, since we're trying to maximize preferences,

127
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:37,060
and the preference for teams in the same division

128
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:40,000
is to play later on.

129
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,550
In the next video, we'll see the different types of constraints

130
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:47,700
that we can add to an integer optimization model.
