1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,060
In this lecture, we'll introduce linear optimization

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:05,725
and apply it to airline revenue management.

3
00:00:05,725 --> 00:00:09,560


4
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:13,230
Air transportation became a reality in the United States

5
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:14,650
in the 20th century.

6
00:00:14,650 --> 00:00:19,250
From 1938 to 1978, the Civil Aeronautics Board

7
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:23,420
set fares, routes, and schedules for all interstate air

8
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:24,570
transport.

9
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:27,680
Most airlines were very positive on this system,

10
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:29,520
as it guaranteed their profits.

11
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:32,479
However, this system led to higher costs for a traveling

12
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:35,210
public as well as to various inefficiencies.

13
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:38,600
For example, applications for new routes and fares

14
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:42,500
were often delayed or dismissed.

15
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:45,060
In response to these inefficiencies,

16
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:47,650
the administration of President Carter

17
00:00:47,650 --> 00:00:51,310
passed the Airline Deregulation Act in 1978.

18
00:00:51,310 --> 00:00:54,070
The act encouraged more competition.

19
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:57,140
As a result, 52 new airlines were

20
00:00:57,140 --> 00:01:00,490
formed between 1980 and 2000.

21
00:01:00,490 --> 00:01:05,209
Also, new air routes appeared.

22
00:01:05,209 --> 00:01:07,270
Correspondingly, it saved passengers

23
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:12,810
an estimated $10.3 billion each year in travel time.

24
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:16,110
Lower fares was another outcome.

25
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:22,690
Ticket prices are now 40% lower than they were in 1978.

26
00:01:22,690 --> 00:01:25,960
This led to more passengers.

27
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:30,190
The number of air passengers increased from over 200 million

28
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:39,490
in 1974 to over 720 million in 2010.

29
00:01:39,490 --> 00:01:41,820
More competition led to lower fares,

30
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:44,700
as we discussed, while meeting operating costs.

31
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:48,210
This further led to heavy losses by air carriers.

32
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:52,690
Nine major carriers and more than a hundred smaller airlines

33
00:01:52,690 --> 00:01:56,700
went bankrupt between 1978 and 2002.

34
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:00,175
So it is natural to ask how did airlines compete?

35
00:02:00,175 --> 00:02:03,710


36
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:06,000
In their attempt to sell more seats,

37
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,320
airlines started to offer deep discounts.

38
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:13,240
For example, on January 17, 1985,

39
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:17,820
American Airlines launched its Ultimate Super Saver fares

40
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:20,450
to compete with PeopleExpress.

41
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:23,540
The key strategy involved selling enough seats

42
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:27,600
to cover fixed operating costs while selling remaining

43
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:31,200
seats at higher rates to maximize revenues.

44
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,010
This led to the science of revenue management

45
00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:35,790
that we'll study in this lecture.

46
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:39,430


47
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:41,810
The key question in revenue management

48
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:45,190
is how many seats to sell on discount.

49
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:47,320
The key consideration is that passengers

50
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:48,950
have different valuations.

51
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:52,700
For example, business people value flexibility,

52
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:57,300
whereas people seeking a vacation value good deals.

53
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:59,900
So if we sell too many discounted seats,

54
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:01,440
then there would not be enough seats

55
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,200
for high-paying passengers.

56
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:06,470
At the same time, if we sell too few discounted seats,

57
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:12,170
then we will have empty seats, which lead to lost revenue.

58
00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:15,530
So the key question is how airlines like American

59
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:18,460
can allocate their seats among customers in order

60
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:21,030
to maximize their revenue.
