1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,865
Radiation therapy is one of the most well-used applications

2
00:00:03,865 --> 00:00:06,870
of optimization in health care.

3
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:09,390
In practice, radiation machines are

4
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:12,280
connected to treatment planning software that

5
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:14,740
implements and solves optimization

6
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:19,050
models, both linear optimization models, like we saw here,

7
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:22,410
and other types of optimization models.

8
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:25,010
Some examples of radiation machines

9
00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:29,830
that use optimization software are Pinnacle by Philips,

10
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:36,290
RayStation by RaySearch Labs, and Eclipse by Varian.

11
00:00:36,290 --> 00:00:39,270
There are many extensions to the optimization model

12
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:40,940
that we described here.

13
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:44,320
One is the selection of the beam angles.

14
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:48,110
The beam angles can be selected jointly with the intensity

15
00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:52,180
profiles by using integer optimization.

16
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:55,110
This allows the treatment to be further personalized

17
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:59,820
to the specific tumor and person receiving the radiation.

18
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:04,050
Integer optimization is another type of an optimization model,

19
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:07,030
and will be the topic of next week.

20
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:11,240
Another extension is accounting for uncertainty.

21
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:13,830
Often, the quality of IMRT treatments

22
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:17,670
is degraded due to uncertain organ motion.

23
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:21,000
For example, in lung cancer, the target area

24
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,530
is around the lungs.

25
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:24,480
But since the patient is breathing

26
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:27,590
throughout the treatment, the target area is moving,

27
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:30,660
and the location is slightly uncertain.

28
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:33,060
We can manage this uncertainty using

29
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:36,890
a method known as robust optimization.

30
00:01:36,890 --> 00:01:40,380
There's a significant amount of literature on this method

31
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:45,160
and its application to radiation therapy.

32
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:47,410
Linear optimization significantly

33
00:01:47,410 --> 00:01:50,990
improves the efficiency of radiation therapy.

34
00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:53,690
Manually designing an IMRT treatment

35
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:56,460
would be inefficient and impractical.

36
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:59,720
By using linear optimization, IMRT

37
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:03,930
can be designed in an efficient and systematic way.

38
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:07,000
As we saw in this lecture, clinical criteria

39
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,310
can be modeled using constraints,

40
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:11,970
and the treatment planner can explore trade-offs

41
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:14,560
by changing the model.

42
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:18,410
But ultimately, IMRT and the use of optimization

43
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:20,350
benefits the patient.

44
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:22,870
In head and neck cancers, the saliva glands

45
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:25,850
were rarely spared prior to IMRT.

46
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:28,990
But by using optimized IMRT treatments,

47
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:32,350
saliva glands now can be spared.

48
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:35,940
In prostate cancer, optimized IMRT treatments

49
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:39,790
reduce toxicities and allow for higher tumor doses

50
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:42,020
to be delivered safely.

51
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:45,230
And in lung cancer, optimized IMRT

52
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:49,970
reduced the risk of radiation induced pneumonitis.

53
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:54,690
These are just three examples of the benefits of IMRT.

54
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:58,670
Overall, optimized IMRT allows clinicians

55
00:02:58,670 --> 00:03:01,890
to deliver treatment that was previously impossible,

56
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:05,460
and to improve quality of life for patients.
