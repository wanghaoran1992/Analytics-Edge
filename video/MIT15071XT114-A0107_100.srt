00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,499


1
00:00:00,499 --> 00:00:03,960
So far, we've only considered optimizing the fares

2
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:05,850
for a single route.

3
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:09,050
In this video, we'll change our optimization formulation

4
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:11,810
to include connecting flights.

5
00:00:11,810 --> 00:00:15,850
Now, instead of just being able to go from JFK in New York

6
00:00:15,850 --> 00:00:19,950
to LAX in Los Angeles, let's suppose that the plane stops

7
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:23,390
in Dallas, at the Dallas Fort Worth airport.

8
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:27,300
Then passengers can fly from New York to Dallas, Dallas

9
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:29,670
to Los Angeles, or they can still

10
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:34,500
fly from New York to Los Angeles by flying through Dallas.

11
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:37,500
So how does our optimization problem change?

12
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:40,030
We now have six types of seats that we

13
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:44,010
can offer-- the original two types, regular and discount,

14
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:48,620
from New York to LA, and then two types for the new flights--

15
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:52,760
New York to Dallas, and Dallas to LA.

16
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:55,780
We know the price of each type of ticket

17
00:00:55,780 --> 00:00:59,060
and the forecasted demand for each type of ticket.

18
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:01,410
We also know that we have a capacity

19
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:05,860
of 166 for each leg of the trip.

20
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:08,140
So what are our decisions now?

21
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:09,780
They're a number of regular seats

22
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:14,270
to sell for each leg of the trip and the number of discount

23
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:15,980
seats to sell.

24
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:20,460
So in total, we have six decisions to make.

25
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:22,440
Now, what's our objective?

26
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:26,050
Like before, it's to maximize the total revenue.

27
00:01:26,050 --> 00:01:29,450
This is the sum of the price of the ticket times the number

28
00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:33,960
of seats of that type we sell.

29
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:37,830
And like before, we have two types of constraints-- capacity

30
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:40,420
constraints and demand constraints.

31
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:42,890
For the capacity constraints, the airline

32
00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:46,090
shouldn't sell more seats than the capacity of each plane.

33
00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:48,670
We need two capacity constraints here,

34
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:52,440
one for the New York to Dallas leg, and one for the Dallas

35
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:54,830
to LA leg.

36
00:01:54,830 --> 00:01:57,370
We also need six demand constraints,

37
00:01:57,370 --> 00:02:00,030
one for each type of ticket.

38
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:02,230
The number of seats sold should not

39
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:06,380
exceed the forecasted demand for each type.

40
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:09,539
Lastly, we can't sell a negative number of seats,

41
00:02:09,539 --> 00:02:11,720
so we have our non-negativity constraints

42
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:14,940
to prevent the variables from being negative.

43
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:18,590
Let's now go to LibreOffice and adjust our formulation

44
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:22,020
to solve this bigger problem.

45
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:24,199
In LibreOffice, go ahead and open the file

46
00:02:24,199 --> 00:02:25,490
Week9_AirlineRM_Connecting.ods.

47
00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:30,310


48
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:33,820
In this file, I've set up our data, our decisions,

49
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:36,800
our objective, and our constraints.

50
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,640
Our decisions again are highlighted in yellow.

51
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:44,830
We have a decision for each type of seat on each flight.

52
00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:48,570
Our objective here is the spot in blue.

53
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:52,040
To build our objective, we'll use the sumproduct function.

54
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:57,510
So type equals, and then sumproduct, and in parentheses,

55
00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:01,500
select all six prices, type a semicolon,

56
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:04,430
and then select all six decisions.

57
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:07,190
Close the parentheses, and hit Enter.

58
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:09,560
We see here, like we did before, that we

59
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:12,630
have zero in our objective, because right now, we're

60
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:15,400
not selling any seats.

61
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,930
Now, let's create our constraints.

62
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:21,380
The first constraints are capacity constraints.

63
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:25,950
The first is the capacity on the leg from New York to Dallas.

64
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:29,690
The left hand side should be equal to the seats

65
00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:38,160
from New York to LA, plus the seats from New York to Dallas.

66
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:41,480
The sign is less than or equals, and the right hand side

67
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:45,900
is 166, the capacity of our aircraft.

68
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:49,030
Now, we need to build the capacity constraint from Dallas

69
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:50,260
to LA.

70
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:53,230
The left hand side is equal to the seats from New York

71
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:57,440
to LA plus the seats from Dallas to LA.

72
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:00,220


73
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:02,590
Our sign is, again, less than or equals,

74
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:06,140
and our right hand side is 166.

75
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:09,940
For the demand constraints and the non-negativity constraints,

76
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:12,230
because we have six of each this time,

77
00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:15,760
we'll actually make them in a more efficient way than before.

78
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,370
So we just have a note down there

79
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:20,630
that we need to remember to add these constraints.

80
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:25,110
So now, go ahead and in the Tools menu, select Solver.

81
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:27,660
We need to first fill in the Target cell, which

82
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:29,880
should be the objective.

83
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:33,070
Make sure that Maximum is selected.

84
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:39,320
Then in the Changing cells box, select all six decisions.

85
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:41,360
Down in the Limiting conditions, let's now

86
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,120
build our constraints.

87
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,450
For the Cell reference column, let's start

88
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:48,430
by selecting the left hand side of the two capacity

89
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:49,860
constraints.

90
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:52,780
The Operator should be less than or equals,

91
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:54,510
and the Value should be the right hand

92
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:58,130
side of these two capacity constraints.

93
00:04:58,130 --> 00:05:00,840
Now, let's make the demand constraints.

94
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:04,880
In Cell reference, just directly select the six decision

95
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,610
variables.

96
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:09,350
Make sure the Operator is less than or equals,

97
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:13,480
and for the Value, select the six demand constraints.

98
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,662
This was a bit easier than what we did before,

99
00:05:15,662 --> 00:05:17,120
because we didn't have to type them

100
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,420
all out in our spreadsheet.

101
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:21,060
Now, let's do a similar thing for

102
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:24,260
the non-negativity constraints, where in Cell reference,

103
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:26,690
we select the six decisions.

104
00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:30,230
The Operator this time should be greater than or equals,

105
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:33,370
and for the Value, just type zero.

106
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:37,630
Make sure in Options that the Linear Solver is selected,

107
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:40,800
and go ahead and hit Solve.

108
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,870
The solving result should say: "Solving successfully finished.

109
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:48,540
Result: 120,514".

110
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:50,410
This is our total revenue.

111
00:05:50,410 --> 00:05:53,090
Go ahead and click Keep Result, and let's

112
00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:55,070
take a look at our solution.

113
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:57,730
So we see here that the optimal solution

114
00:05:57,730 --> 00:06:02,240
is to sell 80 tickets for the regular price from New

115
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:07,240
York to LA, zero of the discount price from New York to LA,

116
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:11,470
75 of the regular price from New York to Dallas,

117
00:06:11,470 --> 00:06:15,340
11 of the discount price from New York to Dallas,

118
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:18,580
60 of the regular price from Dallas to LA,

119
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:23,150
and lastly, 26 of the discount price from Dallas to LA.

120
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:25,550
We saw here that we could pretty easily

121
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:29,150
solve a more complicated problem in LibreOffice

122
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:32,636
that we probably couldn't have solved as easily by inspection.

123
00:06:32,636 --> 00:06:33,136
