0
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,590


1
00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:03,360
In the previous video, we used linear optimization

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:04,915
to allocate ads.

3
00:00:04,915 --> 00:00:07,040
In this video, we're going to use a greedy approach

4
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:08,996
to allocate ads to queries.

5
00:00:08,996 --> 00:00:11,370
The approach is called greedy because we allocate the ads

6
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:13,730
sequentially and we prioritize which

7
00:00:13,730 --> 00:00:15,525
combinations of ad and query to use,

8
00:00:15,525 --> 00:00:18,570
based on the average price per display.

9
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:20,070
So here we have a spreadsheet set up

10
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:22,360
in the same way as the one from the previous video

11
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:23,360
with some minor tweaks.

12
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:26,830
If we scroll down, we have this table here,

13
00:00:26,830 --> 00:00:29,720
which has cells corresponding to combinations of advertisers

14
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:33,270
and queries, which tells us basically how many times we

15
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:35,150
display a particular advertiser's

16
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:37,550
ad with a particular query.

17
00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:39,895
But to the side here, we have another table

18
00:00:39,895 --> 00:00:42,750
which we will use to keep track at every stage

19
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:46,430
of our allocation process, how much we can allocate--

20
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:49,940
how many displays we can perform of a particular ad

21
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:53,000
with a particular query, based on the budget,

22
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,280
and based on how many displays of each query

23
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:58,770
remain unallocated.

24
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:01,150
Further down, where we have our constraints,

25
00:01:01,150 --> 00:01:03,140
we've added some new cells here, which

26
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:04,814
are labeled with the word "Remaining,"

27
00:01:04,814 --> 00:01:07,530
to indicate how much of the budgets of each advertiser

28
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:11,560
remaining, and how many displays of each query

29
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:13,800
remain unallocated.

30
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:16,941
So let's get started with our greedy allocation.

31
00:01:16,941 --> 00:01:19,190
So to start, we go up to our Average Price Per Display

32
00:01:19,190 --> 00:01:22,760
table, and we find the combination

33
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:24,720
of advertiser and query which gives us

34
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,240
the largest average price per display.

35
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:29,920
So, in this case, the largest average price per display

36
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,010
is five.

37
00:01:31,010 --> 00:01:37,564
And this happens when we display Verizon's ad with Query 3.

38
00:01:37,564 --> 00:01:39,230
So this is the first variable that we're

39
00:01:39,230 --> 00:01:41,820
going to change in our greedy allocation.

40
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:44,790
These are the first, basically the first displays

41
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:46,340
that we're going to use.

42
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:53,020
So if we scroll down, we add Verizon in Query 3.

43
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:54,720
And to figure out the budget limit,

44
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:59,076
we go to Verizon's remaining budget which is $160.

45
00:01:59,076 --> 00:02:04,480
And so we take that $160, and we divide it

46
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:07,250
through by the average price per display of $5.

47
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:10,199
So, we get this number 32, and so what this means

48
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:12,963
is that we can display Verizon's ad with Query 3,

49
00:02:12,963 --> 00:02:17,940
32 times based solely on the remaining budget of Verizon.

50
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:21,330
Now, of course, we also have to respect how many displays

51
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:23,840
are unallocated of each query, and for query 3,

52
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,370
we have 80 displays.

53
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:28,960
So the query limit at this stage is 80.

54
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,780
So now how many times do we actually

55
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:33,020
display Verizon's ad with Query 3?

56
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:36,140
Well, the most that we can display Verizon's ad with Query

57
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:39,220
3 is going to be the smaller of these two numbers.

58
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:43,130
And so in this case the smaller of the two numbers is 32.

59
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:48,790
So, we allocate Verizon's ad to Query 3, 32 times.

60
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:52,640
So now after we've changed the value of this variable,

61
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:56,600
you can see that the budget of Verizon has changed.

62
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:57,630
So now it is 0.

63
00:02:57,630 --> 00:03:00,230
So we've completely extinguished Verizon's budget,

64
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:03,500
and the remaining unallocated displays for Query 3

65
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:04,650
has also changed.

66
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:08,550
So this number used to be 80 and now it is 48.

67
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:11,720
So, since we've extinguished Verizon's budget,

68
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:14,340
we go back up to our Average Price Per Display table.

69
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:16,910
And so now we have to select a new combination

70
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:18,660
to use in our allocation.

71
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:20,470
Since we've used up Verizon's budget,

72
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:25,490
we're going to highlight these cells corresponding to Verizon.

73
00:03:25,490 --> 00:03:29,380
We're going to highlight them in red

74
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:32,130
to indicate that we can't use any of those combinations

75
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:32,900
anymore.

76
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:34,660
And from the remaining cells in the table,

77
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:39,540
we want to find the combination of Advertiser and Query

78
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:42,740
that gives us the largest average price per display.

79
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:44,830
So in this case, the next highest

80
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:47,480
is for T-Mobile and Query 3, and in this case

81
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:49,350
the average price per display is two.

82
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:51,270
So this is the next combination that we'll

83
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:53,280
use in our allocation.

84
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:58,340
So if we scroll down, we add T-Mobile and Query 3.

85
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:00,470
So now we have to calculate the budget limit.

86
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:03,330
T-Mobile's remaining budget is $100.

87
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:08,790
We take $100, and we divide it through by $2 per display,

88
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:11,440
and we get this value of 50.

89
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:14,390
And the query limit for T-Mobile and query 3

90
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:17,519
is the remaining number of displays for Query 3,

91
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:18,800
which is 48.

92
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,339
So we scroll up and we add 48.

93
00:04:20,339 --> 00:04:22,832


94
00:04:22,832 --> 00:04:24,540
And so now, how many times do we actually

95
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:26,780
display T-Mobile's ad with Query 3?

96
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:28,690
Well, that number is 48, because 48

97
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:30,750
is the smaller of the two numbers.

98
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:34,110
So we go ahead and we add that.

99
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:35,900
And so now T-Mobile's budget has changed.

100
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:38,320
So it's dropped from 100 to four,

101
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:41,320
and the remaining displays of Query 3,

102
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:43,390
that number has dropped to 0.

103
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:45,090
So there are no more displays of Query 3

104
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:47,181
remaining that we can use.

105
00:04:47,181 --> 00:04:49,430
So now we move on to the next stage of our allocation,

106
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:52,610
and we go back to the Average Price Per Display table.

107
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:56,180
And since we've used up all of the displays of Query 3,

108
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:58,930
we're going to highlight the remaining cells corresponding

109
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:02,660
to Query 3 in red, just to remind us

110
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:03,990
that we can't use them.

111
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:05,660
And so now from the remaining cells,

112
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:09,310
again, we want to find the highest average price

113
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:10,635
per display combination.

114
00:05:10,635 --> 00:05:14,250
And so from the remaining cells, the highest average price

115
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:18,060
per display occurs when we use T-Mobile's ad with Query 1.

116
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:21,630
So that's the next variable that we'll use in our allocation.

117
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:27,746
So we scroll back down and we add T-Mobile with Query 1.

118
00:05:27,746 --> 00:05:30,120
To compute the budget limit, we take T-Mobile's remaining

119
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:32,980
budget which is four, $4, and we divide it

120
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:36,450
through by the average price per display of $1.

121
00:05:36,450 --> 00:05:40,000
So, we get four displays according to the budget.

122
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,640
And the query limit, in this case,

123
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:45,620
is 140, because there are 140 displays of Query 1

124
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:49,685
that haven't been used towards any ad.

125
00:05:49,685 --> 00:05:51,060
Now how many times do we actually

126
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:53,170
display T-Mobile's with Query 1?

127
00:05:53,170 --> 00:05:55,980
Again, we just take the minimum of these two quantities, which

128
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:57,200
is four.

129
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:00,090
We go ahead and we enter that into our table.

130
00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:02,310
So now if you look at the budgets,

131
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:05,140
we've completely extinguished T-Mobile's budget

132
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:08,560
and the remaining number of displays of Query 1

133
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:13,610
that haven't been allocated has dropped to 136.

134
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:17,830
So now we move on to the next stage of our allocation.

135
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:19,840
Again, we've eliminated T-Mobile's budget.

136
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:25,130
So now we highlight those cells in red.

137
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:27,340
And so now, we want to pick the highest average price

138
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:29,099
per display from the remaining cells.

139
00:06:29,099 --> 00:06:31,640
Now in this case, the only two combinations that remain to us

140
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:33,620
are to display AT&T's ad with Query 1

141
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:37,080
and to display AT&T's ad with Query 2.

142
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:39,380
Both of these have the same average price per display,

143
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:42,270
so it doesn't matter which one we really choose.

144
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:44,680
But for the purpose of this solution,

145
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:48,870
let's just go with AT&T displayed with Query 1.

146
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:51,850
So the average price per display is 0.5.

147
00:06:51,850 --> 00:06:56,422
So we go down, we add that entry to our side table here.

148
00:06:56,422 --> 00:06:57,880
And to compute the budget limit, we

149
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:03,070
take AT&T's remaining budget of 170,

150
00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:06,040
and we divide it through by 0.5.

151
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,920
To get the query limit, we just look

152
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:11,400
at the number of remaining displays of Query 1,

153
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,620
which is 136.

154
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:15,410
So we add that.

155
00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:18,170
And so now, obviously, the smaller of the two quantities

156
00:07:18,170 --> 00:07:19,670
is 136.

157
00:07:19,670 --> 00:07:25,430
So we'll display AT&T's ad with Query 1, 136 times.

158
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:28,890
So now if we look at the state of our allocation,

159
00:07:28,890 --> 00:07:33,100
we've basically used up all the displays of Query 1.

160
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:36,110
And we've used up some part of AT&T's budget,

161
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:38,320
though there's still a lot left.

162
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:42,060
So now we go back up and we now proceed

163
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:47,000
to make the next allocation in our greedy solution.

164
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,060
We've eliminated AT&T in Query 1.

165
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:54,370
So now the only combination that remains is AT&T with Query 2.

166
00:07:54,370 --> 00:07:56,660
So we go down.

167
00:07:56,660 --> 00:07:59,560
We add that entry to our side table.

168
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:01,380
And so now to get the budget limit,

169
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:07,150
we take AT&T's remaining budget of $102,

170
00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:10,130
and we divide it through by 0.5, which

171
00:08:10,130 --> 00:08:14,050
is the average price per display to get 204.

172
00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:17,760
And the query limit now is 80, because 80

173
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:23,380
is the number of remaining unassigned displays of Query 2.

174
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:25,960
And now the smaller of the two numbers is 80.

175
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:29,440
And so we add 80 to our table.

176
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,975
And so at this point, we've gone through all the entries

177
00:08:31,975 --> 00:08:33,600
in our average price per display table,

178
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:37,360
and we've eliminated basically all of them.

179
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,210
And in terms of the allocation, we

180
00:08:39,210 --> 00:08:42,130
know that we can't make any more allocations, because if we look

181
00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:46,560
at our constraints, basically, there are no more displays

182
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:49,690
of any query that have not been assigned to any advertiser.

183
00:08:49,690 --> 00:08:52,250
So all of these entries here are 0.

184
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:56,430
And in this case, AT&T's budget is still some positive value.

185
00:08:56,430 --> 00:09:01,150
So we still have $62 of AT&T’s budget remaining.

186
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:04,240
But since we don't have any more displays of any query

187
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,760
that we can use, we are basically done.

188
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:09,260
So this is our greedy solution.

189
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:11,610
And so there are a couple of interesting things

190
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:14,140
to note about this greedy solution.

191
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:17,572
So the first is that the actual combinations that

192
00:09:17,572 --> 00:09:19,030
are used by the greedy solution are

193
00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:21,400
different from those that are made

194
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:23,810
by the linear optimization based solution.

195
00:09:23,810 --> 00:09:26,680
So for example, in the optimization solution,

196
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:30,330
if you recall, we only used Query 3 with AT&T.

197
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:34,275
So we only displayed-- whenever we displayed an ad with Query

198
00:09:34,275 --> 00:09:36,490
3, it was only AT&T’s ad.

199
00:09:36,490 --> 00:09:39,440
But in this case, we don't actually

200
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:42,330
display AT&T's ad with Query 3 ever.

201
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:46,550
And in fact, we display only T-Mobile's ad and Verizon's ad

202
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:47,620
with Query 3.

203
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:51,510
We don't use AT&T. So that's-- so the actual allocation

204
00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:55,410
changes and so as a result, the revenue that we get from

205
00:09:55,410 --> 00:09:58,970
the greedy solution is different from the revenue that we get

206
00:09:58,970 --> 00:10:00,730
from the optimization solution.

207
00:10:00,730 --> 00:10:04,360
If you recall, the revenue from the optimization solution

208
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:06,640
was $428.

209
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:09,360
Now, this may not seem like a very large difference.

210
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,340
So this is a difference of $60.

211
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:17,210
But in relative terms, this is actually a rather large amount,

212
00:10:17,210 --> 00:10:26,030
368 relative to 428 is roughly 14 percent.

213
00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:30,090
And so, hopefully this illustrates the fact

214
00:10:30,090 --> 00:10:31,690
that an optimization based solution

215
00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:35,530
can provide a significant difference in performance

216
00:10:35,530 --> 00:10:39,070
relative to a basic common sense solution.

217
00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:41,605
So this concludes our construction and our discussion

218
00:10:41,605 --> 00:10:43,620
of the greedy solution.

219
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:47,200
In the next video, we will go back to our linear optimization

220
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:51,400
model, and we will consider some of the sensitivity analysis

221
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,535
that goes along with that model.

222
00:10:53,535 --> 00:10:54,035
