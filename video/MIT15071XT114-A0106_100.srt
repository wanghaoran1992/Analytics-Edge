1
00:00:01,270 --> 00:00:04,110
Often, in linear optimization problems,

2
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:07,260
we've estimated the data we're using in the problem,

3
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:09,640
but it's subject to change.

4
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:13,290
Understanding how the solution changes when the data changes

5
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:16,290
is called sensitivity analysis.

6
00:00:16,290 --> 00:00:18,540
One way that the data could change

7
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:20,740
is through marketing decisions.

8
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:23,300
Suppose that American Airlines' management

9
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:25,360
is trying to figure out whether or not

10
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:29,850
it would be beneficial to invest in marketing its fares.

11
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:32,299
They forecast that the marketing effort

12
00:00:32,299 --> 00:00:36,560
is likely to attract one more unit of demand, of each type,

13
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:38,940
for every $200 spent.

14
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:43,370
So for the discount fare, the marketing cost per unit

15
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:46,670
is $200, and for the regular fare,

16
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:50,690
the marketing cost per unit is also $200.

17
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:53,250
We want to know how much this will increase

18
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:58,590
our marginal revenue for each type of fare.

19
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:01,950
This graph shows our current feasible space and optimal

20
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:03,240
solution.

21
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:06,260
What would happen if we increased the marketing

22
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:08,210
for discount fares?

23
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:11,060
The demand for discount fares would increase.

24
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:14,120
But since we're not even meeting the current demand for discount

25
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:16,670
fares with the optimal solution, this

26
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:19,850
doesn't give us any extra revenue.

27
00:01:19,850 --> 00:01:24,070
So we shouldn't add any marketing for discount fares.

28
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:28,240
Actually, American Airlines could decrease their budget

29
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:31,810
to market discount fares, and even if the demand decreases,

30
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:34,020
it wouldn't change our revenue.

31
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:36,880
The demand could go all the way down to 66

32
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:39,780
without affecting our decisions.

33
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:42,280
In sensitivity analysis like this,

34
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:46,710
we're often concerned with the shadow price of a constraint.

35
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:48,950
For a discount demand constraint,

36
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:51,620
this is the marginal revenue gained

37
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:54,630
by increasing the demand by one unit.

38
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:57,940
In this case, the shadow price is 0 for demand

39
00:01:57,940 --> 00:02:01,670
greater than or equal to 66.

40
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:06,230
Now, let's look at what happens when we market regular fares.

41
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:09,120
If we increase the demand for regular fares,

42
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:12,020
our revenue increases.

43
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:15,050
If we increase by 25 units of demand,

44
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:20,380
our revenue increases to $86,883.

45
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:23,930
If we increase by another 25 units of demand,

46
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:29,440
our revenue increases to $96,358.

47
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:32,650
So what's the shadow price in this case?

48
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:34,700
Remember that the shadow price is

49
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:38,550
the marginal revenue for a unit increase in demand,

50
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:41,440
in this case, of regular seats.

51
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:45,790
From 100 to 125, the revenue increased

52
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:59,480
by $86,883 minus $77,408, which is equal to $9,475.

53
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:03,250
Since this was an increase of 25 units of demand,

54
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:08,040
the shadow price is 9,475 divided

55
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:12,540
by 25, which equals 379.

56
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:14,990
We can calculate that this is the same shadow

57
00:03:14,990 --> 00:03:19,220
price from 125 to 150.

58
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:21,990
So the marginal revenue for every extra unit

59
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:29,670
of regular demand from 100 to 166 is $379.

60
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:32,120
So given this analysis, how can we

61
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:35,420
help the marketing department make their decisions?

62
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:41,020
The forecast was an extra unit of demand for every $200 spent.

63
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:44,040
For discount fares, this isn't worth it, since the shadow

64
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:47,510
price, or marginal revenue, is 0.

65
00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:50,340
But for the regular fares, this is worth it,

66
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:54,180
since the shadow price is $379.

67
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:56,020
So the marketing department should

68
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:58,590
invest in marketing regular fares

69
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:01,010
to increase the demand by 66 units.

70
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:03,850


71
00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:07,410
Another sensitivity analysis question in our problem

72
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:10,760
is whether or not it would be beneficial to allocate a bigger

73
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:13,050
aircraft for this flight.

74
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:15,290
This would change the capacity constraint,

75
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:19,390
which currently limits the capacity to 166.

76
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:21,860
With our current aircraft, the management

77
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:26,950
knows that the cost per hour is $12,067.

78
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:33,680
So the total cost of the six-hour flight is $72,402.

79
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:37,450
With the 166 seats filled, we get a revenue

80
00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:42,530
of $77,408 from our optimal solution.

81
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:47,490
If we increase the capacity of the aircraft to 176 seats,

82
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:53,030
the total cost would increase to $76,590.

83
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:56,310
But how much would this increase our revenue?

84
00:04:56,310 --> 00:05:01,080
And if we increase the capacity of the aircraft to $218,

85
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:06,230
the total cost would increase to $87,342.

86
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:09,680
But how much would this increase our revenue?

87
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:13,080
For our analysis, let's assume that the demand does not

88
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,590
change.

89
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:18,520
If we increase our capacity to 176,

90
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:21,170
the capacity constraint will move right.

91
00:05:21,170 --> 00:05:23,900
And our optimal solution will move right too.

92
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:29,520
We now get a revenue of $79,788.

93
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:33,480
If we then increase the capacity to 218 seats,

94
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:36,140
the capacity constraint will move right again,

95
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:41,890
and our revenue will increase to $89,784.

96
00:05:41,890 --> 00:05:43,900
So let's look at our extra profit

97
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:47,630
from increasing the capacity to see if it's worth it.

98
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:53,940
With our current costs and revenue, the profit is $5,006.

99
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:57,700
If we increase the capacity to 176 seats,

100
00:05:57,700 --> 00:06:03,350
our profit actually decreases to $3,198.

101
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:07,390
And if we increase the capacity to 218 seats,

102
00:06:07,390 --> 00:06:12,580
our profit decreases even more to $2,442.

103
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:15,470
So even though our revenue is increasing,

104
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:17,210
the cost increases too.

105
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:19,820
So it's not profitable for us to increase

106
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:22,610
the capacity of our aircraft.

107
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:26,170
You can also see this by using LibreOffice, which we'll

108
00:06:26,170 --> 00:06:29,390
ask you to do in the next quick question.
