### Introduction:
The project focuses on discovering the relationship between the highest degree earned and the total family income in the United States. Many of us may usually have such an intuition that the higher a person's level of degree is, the richer he or she will be. That intuition may be true in some sense, but a theoretical analysis is definitely needed to study the relationship between the two variables. Also, if it is really the case in which people's degree level is positively proportional to their total family income, then it would be a good incentive for us to pursue a degree as highest as we can. Furthermore, we will be able to have an understanding of how can education make an impact on the  living standard and to help people realize the significance of education from a nationwide perspective.
### Data:
The data come from General Social Survey, or GSS. Data in GSS are collected among all noninstitutionalized, English and Spanish speaking persons with more than 18 years of age, who live in the United States, during a time period from 1972 to 2012. Computer-assisted personal interview, face-to-face interview, telephone interview methods are used in GSS.
The case of the data or unit of observation is individual. The two variables  of interest are the highest degree people have earned and their total family income. Since each variable is divided into several categorical groups, both of them can be regarded as categorical variables. It's an observational study where I make a exploratary data analysis that involves a contingency talbe and graghical figure ,and statistical inference that features chi-square test of independence, to fully discover the relationship between the two variables both intuively and technically.
Population of interest here are US citizens who are at least 18 years old. As discussed above, the generalizability is definitely met for this project since the sample size is large enough and the geographic coverage is the whole United States.
However, one bias may arise that the total family income in the dataset may not be compared directly since the data cover a long time period from 1972 to 2012 and there is no further information on whether or not the family income has been properly adjusted for inflation. But to make our analysis simple, we will assume that the inflation does not play a role here.
The data can not be used to establish causal link between the two variables because we do not have a control group to do further causality study.
### Exploratory data analysis:
Here are the summary statistics of the two variables-highest degree earned and total family income.
```{r }
summary(gss$degree)
summary(gss$income06)
```
We then look at the family income of different degree groups separately and make a plot.
```{r }
table1=table(gss$income06,gss$degree)
plot1=plot(gss$degree~gss$income06)
table1
```
From the table, we can clearly see that as the family income increases, the proportion of higher degree levels, such as Bachelor and Graduate, also gets higher. However, there is an interesting finding that in the right-most bar of the plot that represents the highest income level, the proportion of Bachelor and Graduate degrees do not go up from the previous level. The proportion of the degree of high school increases abruptly. In my opinion, this interesting and unexpected finding may arise when such people as Steve Jobs and Bill Gates do not complete their higher education but rather start their own business and make a huge amount of income from that. Next, let's do some further statistical inferences to see if we can derive more useful information.
### Inference:
Since there are two variables here and each variable has more than 3 levels, we can only do Chi-squre independence test to see if there is an independence between the two variables.
Null hypothesis: total family income is independent of the highest degree earned. Alternative hypothesis: the two variables are not independent.
```{r}
chisq.test(table1)
```
From the chi-square test of independence, our p-value is 2.2e-16. It may not be evident to see what the value exactly is. So let's make a boolean expression of comparing between 2.2e-16 to our significance level of 5% (5% is sufficient to serve as a alpha value here).
```{r}
2.2e-16<0.05
```
We can see that R returns "TRUE", which means that our p-value is smaller than 5%. From the statistical inference, we can infer that the two variables are independent of each other, which justifies our previous finding in exploratory data analysis session.
### Conclusion:
From the data analyasis and statistical inference above, we can safely come to the conclusion that there is a dependence between the highest degree earned and the total family income among adult citizens in the U.S. Generally, as the degree level goes up, the income level increases as well. To some extent, the project justifies our intuition about the relationship between education level and income level. Therefore, if you would intend to make more money in the future, then to pursue a higher degree may not be a bad idea!
