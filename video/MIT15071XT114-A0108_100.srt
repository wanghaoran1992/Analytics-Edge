00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,500


1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,350
The overall revenue management problem

2
00:00:02,350 --> 00:00:05,550
involves a network of airports and literally thousands

3
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:06,750
of flights.

4
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:08,550
Clearly optimization is needed.

5
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:11,530
Myopic solutions leave significant revenue

6
00:00:11,530 --> 00:00:12,160
on the table.

7
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:16,160


8
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:19,480
Furthermore, revenue management involves

9
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:22,990
tens of different classes that have different restrictions,

10
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:26,080
different characteristics like mile awards, and fares.

11
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:30,800


12
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,790
PEOPLExpress could not compete with American Airlines'

13
00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:37,280
Ultimate Super Saver fares.

14
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:40,630
Donald Burr, CEO of PEOPLExpress in 1985,

15
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:43,700
notes, "We were a vibrant, profitable company

16
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:48,620
from 1981 to 1985, and then we tipped right over

17
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:51,370
into losing $50 million a month.

18
00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:52,910
We had been profitable from the day

19
00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:57,360
we started until American came at us with Ultimate Super

20
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,780
Savers."

21
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:01,760
Revenue management is the science

22
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:04,950
of selling the right seats to the right customers

23
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:06,850
at the right prices.

24
00:01:06,850 --> 00:01:09,970
To illustrate the impact that revenue management has

25
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:13,500
had on American Airlines, we note

26
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:16,780
what Robert Crandall, CEO of American,

27
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:21,910
wrote during the period that revenue management

28
00:01:21,910 --> 00:01:23,740
practices were applied.

29
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:26,230
"Revenue management is the single most important

30
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:29,000
technical development in transportation management

31
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,360
since we entered the era of airline deregulation.

32
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:34,550
We estimate that revenue management

33
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:38,730
has generated $1.4 billion in incremental revenue

34
00:01:38,730 --> 00:01:43,050
in the last three years."

35
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:46,120
Let us see the impact of revenue management more broadly.

36
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:52,250
Today, American Airlines has emerged from bankruptcy

37
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:55,370
by merging with US Air Airlines.

38
00:01:55,370 --> 00:01:57,242
However, American Airlines has spun

39
00:01:57,242 --> 00:01:59,890
off Sabre Holdings, the entity that

40
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:03,100
built revenue management for American.

41
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:09,000
As of November 2012, Sabre ranked 133rd

42
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:14,430
among America's largest private companies with $3.15 billion

43
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:20,390
in sales, 400 airlines, 90,000 hotels, and 30 car rental

44
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:22,560
companies as clients.

45
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,560
Today, companies prosper from revenue management.

46
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,920
Delta Airlines, for example, increased annual revenue

47
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,550
by $300 million.

48
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:35,467
Marriott hotels increased annual revenue by $100 million.

49
00:02:35,467 --> 00:02:35,967
