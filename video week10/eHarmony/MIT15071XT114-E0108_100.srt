00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,500


1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,350
In the optimization problem, we assumed

2
00:00:02,350 --> 00:00:04,480
the compatibility scores were data

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:07,890
that we could input directly into the optimization model.

4
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:10,150
But where do these scores come from?

5
00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:14,240
In the words of the founder-- Neil Clark Warren --opposites

6
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:16,320
attract, then they attack.

7
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,180
eHarmony's compatibility match score

8
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:21,070
is based on similarity between users' answers

9
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:23,340
to the questionnaire.

10
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:26,370
Let us attempt to demonstrate an approach

11
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:28,750
to develop compatibility scores.

12
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:32,320
We utilize public data from eHarmony containing features

13
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:37,060
for 275,000 users and binary compatibility.

14
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:39,070
Feature names and exact values are

15
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:41,920
masked to protect users' privacy.

16
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:45,260
Correspondingly we won't be able to directly interpret

17
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:47,400
which features are important as we do not

18
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:50,250
know the identity of these features.

19
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:55,039
We used logistic regression on pairs of users' differences

20
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:56,080
to predict compatibility.

21
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:58,840


22
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:00,520
To reduce the size of the problem,

23
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:05,260
we filtered the data to include only users in the Boston area

24
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:08,710
who have compatibility scores listed in the data set.

25
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:15,020
We computed absolute difference in features for these 1,475

26
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:17,930
pairs and trained a logistic regression model

27
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:20,456
on these differences.

28
00:01:20,456 --> 00:01:24,200
Let us observe the results of this experiment.

29
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:27,340
If we use a low threshold in the logistic regression model,

30
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:30,930
we predict more false positives but also get

31
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:32,140
more true positives.

32
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:34,100
For example, the classification matrix

33
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:37,760
for threshold equal to 0.2 is as follows.

34
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:41,820


35
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:47,580
Note that we found 1,030 pairs that are not compatible

36
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:51,090
and 92 pairs that are compatible correctly.

37
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:58,900
Note that 92 out of 319-- which is 227 plus 92 --of these

38
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:01,780
were correctly identified.

39
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:05,480
That is, 29% percent of the matches we recommend

40
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:10,440
would be successful, a very high success rate for online dating.

41
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:18,310


42
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:20,160
Clearly, there is a potential for using

43
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,170
many other analytic methods.

44
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:25,080
Specifically trees, which are especially

45
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,890
useful for predicting compatibility

46
00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:28,730
if there are nonlinear relationships

47
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:31,090
between variables.

48
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:33,160
Clustering is another potential approach

49
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:35,390
with the idea of segmenting the users.

50
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:38,660
Finally, text analytics is yet another approach

51
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:43,100
with the idea of analyzing the text of users' profiles.

52
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:47,150
Of course, many other techniques are possible.

53
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:49,630
To give some intuition of various features,

54
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:52,220
let us see how the probability of a match

55
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:56,000
changes with the distance between the two adults.

56
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,430
It is interesting to note that the probability drops

57
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:02,770
with distance, and then for a very long distance,

58
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:06,900
the probability increases again.

59
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:09,190
Also interesting is this graph that

60
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:12,890
shows that if the attractiveness is too high or too low,

61
00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:15,160
the probability of a successful match decreases.

62
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:17,990


63
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:22,530
Finally, if the difference in height is too high or too low,

64
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:26,000
the probability of the match also drops.

65
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,480
It seems the sweet spot is a difference in height

66
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:32,370
between four and eight inches.
