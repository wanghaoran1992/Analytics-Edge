00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,500


1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,380
So we saw in the previous video how

2
00:00:02,380 --> 00:00:07,240
we can solve linear optimization problems in LibreOffice.

3
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:09,680
Let's now try to get some intuition for what's

4
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:12,770
going on by visualizing our problem.

5
00:00:12,770 --> 00:00:16,230
Since we only have two decisions, R and D,

6
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:19,570
we can visualize our constraints in two dimensions.

7
00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:24,620
We'll plot D on the x-axis, and R on the y-axis.

8
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:27,370
We first have non-negativity constraints,

9
00:00:27,370 --> 00:00:32,090
so R and D are both greater than zero.

10
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:36,530
We can plot the capacity constraint, R + D less than

11
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:41,330
or equal to 166, which is shown as the red line here.

12
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:44,260
Our solution has to be to the left of this line

13
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:47,530
according to this constraint.

14
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:50,460
Now, let's add in our demand constraints.

15
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:53,960
The regular seats should be less than the demand of 100, which

16
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:58,250
requires the solution to be below this blue line.

17
00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:02,180
And the discount seats should be less than the demand of 150,

18
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:04,140
which requires the solution to be

19
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:07,220
to the left of this green line.

20
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:09,660
Taken together, our constraints define

21
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:12,820
what we call our "feasible space" or the space

22
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:15,170
of all possible values that our decisions can

23
00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:18,620
take according to our constraints.

24
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:22,430
To find the optimal solution now in our feasible space,

25
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:29,990
we have to use the objective, 617*R + 238*D.

26
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:34,410
We can plot this objective in our feasible space.

27
00:01:34,410 --> 00:01:36,050
So to know how many seats we should

28
00:01:36,050 --> 00:01:38,560
sell to achieve a certain revenue,

29
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,430
we can see different values of this line.

30
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:44,800
So to achieve a revenue of $20,000,

31
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:47,730
our solution has to be somewhere on this line in our feasible

32
00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:49,120
space.

33
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:52,440
To achieve a revenue of $40,000, our solution

34
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:55,940
has to be somewhere on this line in our feasible space.

35
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:59,110
And to achieve a revenue of $60,000,

36
00:01:59,110 --> 00:02:02,300
our solution has to be somewhere on this line in our feasible

37
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:04,120
space.

38
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:07,690
Since the revenue is increasing as we move this line up

39
00:02:07,690 --> 00:02:10,620
and our goal is to maximize the revenue,

40
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:13,000
our optimal solution will be where

41
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
this line can't go any further and still

42
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,970
be in our feasible space.

43
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:21,100
So our optimal solution is at this point

44
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:26,430
with a revenue of $77,408.

45
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:28,730
As we can see here, the solution is

46
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:31,850
dependent on how the feasible space was defined.

47
00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:33,940
In the next video, we'll see what

48
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:37,720
happens if our capacity and demands change.
