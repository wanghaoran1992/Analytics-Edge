1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:04,010
In this video, we'll solve our linear optimization problem

2
00:00:04,010 --> 00:00:06,980
in the software LibreOffice.

3
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:10,280
LibreOffice is similar to Microsoft Excel,

4
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:12,240
but it's an open source software,

5
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:15,300
and is available for free on the internet.

6
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:18,630
Another option we could use is OpenOffice.

7
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:22,180
You're welcome to use Excel, OpenOffice, or LibreOffice

8
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:25,750
in this course, and whenever we mention LibreOffice,

9
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:27,400
keep in mind that you could be using

10
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:30,070
one of the other softwares instead.

11
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:32,450
For more information about the options,

12
00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:35,980
see the download instructions on edX.

13
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:38,580
You should have already downloaded and installed

14
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:39,960
LibreOffice.

15
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:42,640
If not, follow the instructions on edX

16
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:46,400
before continuing with this video.

17
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:48,600
Go ahead and open the file, Week9_AirlineRM.ods.

18
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:52,550


19
00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:55,440
I've already set up the data for our problem and places

20
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:58,520
for us to build our decisions, our objective,

21
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:01,060
and our constraints.

22
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:03,680
The decisions are highlighted in yellow.

23
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:06,100
These are the number of regular seats to sell,

24
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:08,600
and the number of discount seats to sell.

25
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:10,850
We'll just leave these cells blank for now,

26
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:15,000
since the solver will be finding the optimal values.

27
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,320
Our objective, which we saw in the previous video,

28
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,820
is to maximize total revenue.

29
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:24,530
Let's go ahead and build the objective in this blue cell.

30
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:27,900
It should equal the price of regular seats,

31
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:30,020
times the number of regular seats

32
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:34,490
we sell, plus the price the discount seats,

33
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:38,220
times the number of discount seats we sell.

34
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:40,330
Go ahead and hit Enter.

35
00:01:40,330 --> 00:01:42,830
You should see 0 in this cell.

36
00:01:42,830 --> 00:01:45,870
That's because right now, we're not selling any seats.

37
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:48,980
Our decision cells are blank.

38
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:50,840
This could be a little tedious if we

39
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,850
had more than two decisions.

40
00:01:52,850 --> 00:01:55,690
To make it easier, we can use a nice function

41
00:01:55,690 --> 00:01:58,840
called sumproduct to build our objective.

42
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:01,970
So go ahead and clear the objective.

43
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:04,980
Now in the objective cell, let's type

44
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:10,710
equals, and then sumproduct, and then in parentheses,

45
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:15,030
select the two prices, type a semicolon,

46
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:17,250
and then select the two seats.

47
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:20,710
This will multiply the first price times the first decision

48
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:23,740
variable, and the second price times the second decision

49
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:26,160
variable, and add them up.

50
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,850
Close the parentheses and hit Enter.

51
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:30,850
Note that if you're using Excel, you

52
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:34,720
should use a comma instead of a semicolon.

53
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:37,280
We should again see 0 in our objective.

54
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:41,860
This is going to have the exact same value it did before.

55
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:44,790
Now let's construct our constraints.

56
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:48,280
The first constraint is the capacity constraint.

57
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:51,050
The green table here allows us to easily write out

58
00:02:51,050 --> 00:02:54,810
our constraints in terms of what's on the left-hand side,

59
00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:59,680
LHS, what the sign is, like equals, less than

60
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,160
or equals, or greater than or equals,

61
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:04,880
and what's on the right-hand side, or RHS,

62
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,550
of the constraint.

63
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:10,010
So for the capacity constraint, the left-hand side

64
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:13,110
is equal to the number of regular seats

65
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:17,030
plus the number of discount seats.

66
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:21,300
The sign is less than or equals, and the right-hand side

67
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:26,030
is 166, the capacity of our aircraft.

68
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:29,620
The regular demand constraint should be the regular number

69
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:32,200
of seats, which should be less than

70
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:37,500
or equal to the regular demand, which equals 100.

71
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,640
The discount demand should be the number

72
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:41,770
of discount seats, which should be

73
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:47,430
less than or equal to the demand, which is equal to 150.

74
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:50,720
Note here that whenever I pick the seats or the demand,

75
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:53,170
I pick those cells up on the top.

76
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:55,480
That's because if we want to change our demand,

77
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:57,430
we could easily change it up at the top,

78
00:03:57,430 --> 00:04:01,010
and all of our constraints will change too.

79
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:04,300
Now, let's add in our non-negativity constraints.

80
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:06,980
So the number of regular seats should

81
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:10,760
be greater than or equal to 0, and the number

82
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:13,785
of discount seats should be greater than or equal to 0.

83
00:04:13,785 --> 00:04:16,990


84
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:19,459
Now we're ready to solve our problem.

85
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:22,100
To do this, we just go to the Tools menu

86
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:25,800
in LibreOffice and select Solver.

87
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:29,080
Now we need to fill in the information about our problem.

88
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:31,840
The "Target cell" should be the objective.

89
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:34,550
So with the blinking cursor in the target cell,

90
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:37,590
select the objective cell.

91
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:39,650
We should also be selecting "Maximum",

92
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:42,692
since we're trying to maximize the total revenue.

93
00:04:42,692 --> 00:04:45,320
The area called "By changing cells"

94
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:47,190
should be our decision variables,

95
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:50,240
so go ahead and select that blank area,

96
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:53,860
and select the decision variables.

97
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:57,020
The "Limiting conditions" are our constraints.

98
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:59,560
The "Cell reference" should be the left-hand side

99
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:02,880
of the constraint, the "Operator" is the sign,

100
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:06,010
and the "Value" is the right-hand side.

101
00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:08,640
For constraints with the same sign, if they're in a row,

102
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:11,730
we could select them at once to be more efficient.

103
00:05:11,730 --> 00:05:14,600
So first, let's select the first three less than

104
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,140
or equal to constraints.

105
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:18,410
We want to make sure the operator is less than

106
00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:22,390
or equal to, the integer and binary options you see here,

107
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:25,840
we'll explain next week, and the value

108
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:29,400
should be the right-hand side of these constraints.

109
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,550
Then we need to add in the greater than or equal to

110
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:32,550
constraints.

111
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:35,520
So select the two left-hand sides.

112
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:38,600
The operator should be greater than or equal to,

113
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:42,580
and the value should be the two right-hand sides.

114
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:45,550
The last thing we want to do is in Options,

115
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:49,930
make sure that the LibreOffice Linear Solver is selected.

116
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:53,870
Click OK, and then hit Solve.

117
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:58,130
The solving result should say: "Solving successfully finished.

118
00:05:58,130 --> 00:06:01,740
Result: 77,408".

119
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:04,720
This is the objective of our optimal solution,

120
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:07,440
and is the total revenue we get.

121
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,770
Go ahead and click Keep Result.

122
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:11,800
And now back in our spreadsheet, we

123
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:17,410
can see that our solution is to sell 100 regular seats and 66

124
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:19,509
discount seats.

125
00:06:19,509 --> 00:06:21,550
You may be thinking that you could have done this

126
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:22,940
without the Solver.

127
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:25,560
But when the problems become more complicated,

128
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:28,000
it's very difficult and often impossible

129
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,010
to solve them by hand.

130
00:06:30,010 --> 00:06:31,910
We'll make our problem more complicated

131
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:35,250
later in the lecture, and solve it in LibreOffice.

132
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:35,876
