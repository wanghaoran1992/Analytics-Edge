00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,880


1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:03,040
Here, we have a spreadsheet in LibreOffice

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:05,180
that contains all of our data.

3
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:06,870
Up here, we have the basic data, which

4
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:10,350
are the price-per-click and click-through-rate.

5
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:13,487
Below, we have the average price per display,

6
00:00:13,487 --> 00:00:14,820
which we will actually be using.

7
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:17,040
Below it, we have the budgets, and below

8
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:19,240
that we have the query estimates.

9
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:21,910
After the data, we then have the variables.

10
00:00:21,910 --> 00:00:26,380
So these are the x_A1s through x_A3s, the x_T1s through x_T3s

11
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:32,740
and the x_V1s through x_V3s that we saw in the previous video.

12
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:37,100
And below those, we have the objective, the constraints,

13
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:38,940
so that the budgets are not exceeded

14
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:42,330
and that the query estimates are not exceeded.

15
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:45,450
So we'll have to fill in all of these expressions, which

16
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:49,440
reflect, for example, how many times query one is used

17
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:52,960
in our advertising strategy, how much of, for instance,

18
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:55,970
T-Mobile's budget we use in your advertising strategy,

19
00:00:55,970 --> 00:01:00,350
as well as the objective, which is the total average revenue

20
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:02,460
from our advertising strategy.

21
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:06,900
Let's start by defining the objective of our problem.

22
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:09,790
To form the objective, we go to the cell next to revenue,

23
00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:11,670
and we start by writing, =SUMPRODUCT.

24
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:15,500


25
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:18,470
The SUMPRODUCT function takes two collections of cells,

26
00:01:18,470 --> 00:01:21,940
multiplies corresponding cells together, and adds them up.

27
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:24,980
Here we want to use SUMPRODUCT to multiply the average prices

28
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:26,950
per display with the number of times

29
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:29,870
we display each ad with each query.

30
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:34,560
Our variables are all the cells between B35 and D37.

31
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,430
And the average price per display

32
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:40,430
is contained in all the cells between B17 and D19.

33
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:42,990
So we need to input these into the function.

34
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:53,270
So we write B35:D37 comma, so the comma indicates that

35
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:56,380
we're moving on to a new collection of cells.

36
00:01:56,380 --> 00:02:03,882
Then we include B17:D19.

37
00:02:03,882 --> 00:02:07,510
We press Enter, and so now we have our expression,

38
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:10,539
which reflects the objective value for our advertising

39
00:02:10,539 --> 00:02:12,160
strategy.

40
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,760
Now to compute how much of each advertiser's budget

41
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:17,750
we're using, we're going to use the average price per display

42
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:21,220
and the decision variables of each individual advertiser.

43
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:24,810
So to get, for example, AT&T's budget usage,

44
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:26,880
we would use SUMPRODUCT again in the same way

45
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,560
that we used it for the objective,

46
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,500
but this time we would use it just

47
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:33,960
for AT&T's decision variables and AT&T's average prices

48
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,529
per display.

49
00:02:35,529 --> 00:02:37,320
So we use SUMPRODUCT again, as I mentioned.

50
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:43,230
So we write =SUMPRODUCT, but this time we select the cells

51
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:45,900
between B35 and D35.

52
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:49,530
So we write B35:D35.

53
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:52,440
These are the cells that correspond to AT&T's decision

54
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:53,870
variables.

55
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:55,630
For the second collection of cells,

56
00:02:55,630 --> 00:03:01,862
we select the cells between B17 and D17.

57
00:03:01,862 --> 00:03:03,320
These are the cells that correspond

58
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:06,810
to AT&T's average prices per display.

59
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:08,980
We can do the same thing for T-Mobile and Verizon.

60
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:12,440
In this case, we don't need to enter the expressions again.

61
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:15,510
We can just simply drag these expressions,

62
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:18,630
and LibreOffice will conveniently

63
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:21,890
fill the expressions in for us.

64
00:03:21,890 --> 00:03:24,930
And now we need to do a similar thing for the number of times

65
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:26,332
that we use each query.

66
00:03:26,332 --> 00:03:28,540
So, for example, to get the number of times query one

67
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:30,200
is used, we need to add the cells

68
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:32,482
corresponding to query one.

69
00:03:32,482 --> 00:03:34,690
In the spreadsheet, these are the cells corresponding

70
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:37,190
to B35 and B37.

71
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:40,010
And in this case, we simply need to add the decision variable

72
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:42,260
cells -- we don't need to multiply them with any other

73
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:43,050
cells.

74
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:44,860
So we just need to use the sum function.

75
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:57,332
So we write =SUM, and again, we're using the cell's B35:B37.

76
00:03:57,332 --> 00:03:59,937
For query two, we have to use SUM again.

77
00:03:59,937 --> 00:04:02,270
And we need to SUM the cells corresponding to query two,

78
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:10,870
so we write =SUM(C35:C37).

79
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:13,030
And for query three, we need to use SUM again,

80
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:16,779
but this time we need to use cells D35 through D37.

81
00:04:16,779 --> 00:04:22,470
So we write D35:D37.

82
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:24,460
So we've now defined all of the expressions

83
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:26,440
that we'll need for our model.

84
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:28,560
Now we need to input the decision variables,

85
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,690
the objective, and the constraints

86
00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:32,830
into the LibreOffice Solver.

87
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:35,190
So we need to first open up the LibreOffice Solver.

88
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:37,520
So we go to Tools.

89
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:40,200
We open up Tools, and we click on Solver.

90
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:44,490


91
00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:47,350
So, to do this now, we need to specify, again

92
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:49,690
as I mentioned, all the pieces of the problem.

93
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:52,490
So for "Target cell" -- so the target cell here is

94
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:53,320
the objective cell.

95
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:55,890
So we need to specify our objective.

96
00:04:55,890 --> 00:04:59,600
So this cell was just B40.

97
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:03,440
And we want to maximize this as we're maximizing revenue.

98
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:06,400
The "changing cells" here are the decision variables.

99
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:09,800
So this is just a collection of cells, B35 through D37.

100
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:16,620
So we write, B35:D37.

101
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:19,370
Now, underneath, these rows corresponding

102
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:21,380
to the "Limiting conditions", these

103
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:23,720
are just the constraints of the problem.

104
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:27,010
In the first row here, we'll handle the budget constraints.

105
00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:30,580
So under "Cell reference" we'll input the budget expression,

106
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:34,900
and these are contained in cells B45 through B47.

107
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:40,300
So we can enter these or we can just click on the input button

108
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:42,810
and just select them in this way.

109
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:44,790
And then we click on the shrink button here.

110
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:47,950


111
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:49,920
Under "Operator", we want to select less than

112
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:52,461
or equal to because we want to ensure that the amount that we

113
00:05:52,461 --> 00:05:54,640
use of each budget is less than the total budget

114
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:56,970
of the advertiser.

115
00:05:56,970 --> 00:05:59,280
And here under "Value", we're going

116
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,900
to select the actual budget amounts, which

117
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:04,050
are on the right hand side of these less than

118
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:05,390
or equal to signs.

119
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:10,250
So we select them, and we put them in.

120
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:12,920
So that handles the budget constraints.

121
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,630
And in the second row here, we're

122
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:17,220
going to handle the query estimate constraints.

123
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:20,180
So here again, under cell reference,

124
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:22,900
we're going to specify the expressions that correspond

125
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:26,320
to how much we use each query in our advertising strategy.

126
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:30,280
And so these are just the cells, B50 through B52,

127
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:34,730
which we select, and we input them into the solver.

128
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:36,840
Under operator, we want to keep it as less than

129
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:39,650
or equal to, because we want to ensure that the amount that we

130
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:42,950
use each query is less than or equal to the expected number

131
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:47,120
of times that we estimate for that query.

132
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:50,420
And under value, we want to input the query estimates,

133
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:53,530
which are just the cells, D50 through D52.

134
00:06:53,530 --> 00:06:58,010
So, we can just select them in this way, and input them.

135
00:06:58,010 --> 00:07:00,470
So, at this point, it might be tempting to think

136
00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:03,710
that we are done, but we have two more things we need to do.

137
00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:05,740
First, we need to tell the solver

138
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:09,140
to explicitly treat this as a linear optimization problem.

139
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:12,370
Second, we need to include another set of constraints.

140
00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:14,990
This set of constraints requires each decision variable

141
00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:16,545
to be greater than or equal to zero,

142
00:07:16,545 --> 00:07:18,170
since it does not make sense to display

143
00:07:18,170 --> 00:07:21,600
an advertiser with a certain query some negative number

144
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,900
of times.

145
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:25,190
Now, while we could include these constraints here,

146
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:28,130
these types of constraints are very common and very typical

147
00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:29,600
in linear optimization models.

148
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,010
They come up all the time.

149
00:07:31,010 --> 00:07:32,510
And, in fact, they come up so often,

150
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:35,190
that solvers often have an option that you can toggle,

151
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:37,830
that incorporates these constraints automatically.

152
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:40,430
So to handle both of these considerations.

153
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:43,110
Let's just click on Options.

154
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:45,810
And under options, where we have the drop down

155
00:07:45,810 --> 00:07:48,950
menu for "Solver engine", we'll click on there,

156
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:51,960
and then we'll select LibreOffice Linear Solver.

157
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:54,830
This indicates to LibreOffice to use the linear optimization

158
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:57,330
solver for this problem.

159
00:07:57,330 --> 00:07:59,670
And under the settings here, one of the settings,

160
00:07:59,670 --> 00:08:03,630
is to assume that the variables are non-negative.

161
00:08:03,630 --> 00:08:06,730
We'll just activate that option and hit OK.

162
00:08:06,730 --> 00:08:08,790
And now we're ready to solve the problem.

163
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:12,976
So if we hit solve, we get this dialogue that

164
00:08:12,976 --> 00:08:15,070
says that solving successfully finished,

165
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:16,830
and that our result, in this case,

166
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:19,950
this is the objective function, was 428.

167
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:22,440
So we have an advertising strategy

168
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:26,660
that achieves an average revenue of $428.

169
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:30,700
Let's just hit here, Keep Result, and just take a look.

170
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:33,730


171
00:08:33,730 --> 00:08:36,280
The cells that we specified as the decision variables

172
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:39,850
have been populated with their optimal values.

173
00:08:39,850 --> 00:08:43,270
So our optimal strategy, based on this linear optimization

174
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:45,150
solution is the following: so we're

175
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:49,670
going to show AT&T with query one 40 times;

176
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:53,760
we're going to show AT&T with query two also 40 times;

177
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:57,220
we're going to show AT&T with query three 80 times;

178
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:59,950
for T-Mobile, we'll show T-Mobile's ad with query one

179
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:03,500
100 times; and we're only going to show Verizon's

180
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:06,650
ad with query two, and we're going to show it 40 times.

181
00:09:06,650 --> 00:09:09,970
So this specifies, completely, the advertising strategy

182
00:09:09,970 --> 00:09:11,250
that Google should use.

183
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:13,190
And this strategy, as we just saw,

184
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:17,820
achieves an average revenue of $428.

185
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:19,320
Let's double check that the solution

186
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:21,610
is feasible by looking at the budgets and the query

187
00:09:21,610 --> 00:09:22,620
estimates.

188
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:24,760
So if we scroll down here, we see

189
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:30,640
that AT&T's budget that we use here is $168.

190
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:35,920
AT&T's actual budget is $170.

191
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:38,200
We can see that for the other two advertisers,

192
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:40,950
that we are in the clear for both of them.

193
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:42,460
Similarly, with the query estimates

194
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:45,180
we can see that for all the queries

195
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:47,340
that we are considering here, we do not

196
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:49,660
use any query more than the estimate

197
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:52,370
for the number of times that we expect to see that query.

198
00:09:52,370 --> 00:09:56,780
And finally, as one last check, all the decision variable

199
00:09:56,780 --> 00:10:00,380
values that we see here are all greater than or equal to zero.

200
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:03,020
So we're not using any advertiser

201
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:05,050
with any query a negative number times, which

202
00:10:05,050 --> 00:10:07,060
obviously would not make sense.

203
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:11,450
So, the solution as a whole is a feasible solution.

204
00:10:11,450 --> 00:10:13,280
In the next video, we'll show how

205
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:15,720
to solve the problem using a greedy common sense

206
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:19,120
approach, where we will allocate ads to queries by prioritizing

207
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:22,090
them by their average price per display.
