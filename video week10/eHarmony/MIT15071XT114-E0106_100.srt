1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,175
In this lecture, we'll discuss how

2
00:00:02,175 --> 00:00:05,050
analytics and, in particular, optimization

3
00:00:05,050 --> 00:00:06,920
is used in online dating.

4
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:10,890
Specifically, we'll discuss the story of the company eHarmony

5
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:12,970
that uses optimization to maximize

6
00:00:12,970 --> 00:00:15,430
the probability of a successful match

7
00:00:15,430 --> 00:00:19,030
between compatible adults.

8
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:22,350
The goal of eHarmony is to take a scientific approach

9
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:25,390
to love and marriage and offer it to the masses

10
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:29,110
through an online dating website focused

11
00:00:29,110 --> 00:00:31,760
on long term relationships.

12
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:33,950
Indicators of success for eHarmony

13
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:38,560
include the fact that nearly 4% of U.S. marriages in 2012

14
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:41,840
are a result of eHarmony.

15
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:45,740
Furthermore, the company has generated, by 2009,

16
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:48,460
over $1 billion in revenue.

17
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:51,620


18
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:53,650
How is eHarmony different?

19
00:00:53,650 --> 00:00:56,640
Unlike other online dating websites,

20
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:01,610
eHarmony does not have users browse other users' profiles.

21
00:01:01,610 --> 00:01:04,970
Instead, eHarmony uses a compatibility score

22
00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:08,460
between two people and uses optimization algorithms

23
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:10,855
to determine the user's best matches.

24
00:01:10,855 --> 00:01:13,390


25
00:01:13,390 --> 00:01:16,560
How does eHarmony compute the compatibility score?

26
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,820
The score is based on 29 different dimensions

27
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:24,460
of personality including character, emotions, values,

28
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:26,620
traits, etc.

29
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:31,340
The calculation involves a 436 questionnaire.

30
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:33,540
The matches must meet at least 25

31
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:36,580
out of 29 compatibility areas.

32
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:41,680
The graph from eHarmony's website shown in this slide

33
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:45,890
describes one such question regarding character.

34
00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:48,210
Let us discuss the history of the company.

35
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:51,230
The founder of the company is Dr. Neil Clark Warren,

36
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:55,400
a clinical psychologist who counseled couples and began

37
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:59,650
to see that many marriages ended in divorce because couples

38
00:01:59,650 --> 00:02:02,160
were not initially compatible.

39
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:05,560
Warren has written many relationship books.

40
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:09,780
Finding the Love of your Life, The Triumphant Marriage,

41
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:12,790
Learning to Live with the Love of Your Life and Loving It,

42
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:17,610
Finding Commitment, and many others.

43
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:21,310
In the late 1990s, after more than 35 years

44
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:24,230
of work as a clinical psychologist and marriage

45
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:27,660
counselor, Warren decided to test his theory

46
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:31,320
that certain characteristics can predict compatibility and lead

47
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:33,890
to more satisfying relationships.

48
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:36,080
After three years of research Warren

49
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,570
developed a model of compatibility

50
00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:42,010
that is now the basis of the company's matching system.

51
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:45,220
The service launched its matching service for singles

52
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:46,500
in 2000.

53
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:50,150
Since then, the company has had about 33 million members,

54
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:54,010
and as of 2008, about 15,000 people

55
00:02:54,010 --> 00:02:57,210
take the eHarmony questionnaire each day.

56
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:59,960
Interested users may fill out the compatibility quiz,

57
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:02,340
but in order to see matches members

58
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:07,170
must pay a membership fee to eHarmony.

59
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:10,050
What is a distinguishing characteristic of eHarmony?

60
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:13,800
While eHarmony was not the first online dating website

61
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,880
and faced serious competition, there

62
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:19,080
is a key difference from other dating websites.

63
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:21,550
eHarmony takes a quantitative optimization approach

64
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:23,650
to matchmaking rather than letting

65
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:26,280
users browse their website.

66
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:28,110
In this lecture, we'll explore some

67
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:31,400
of the analytics eHarmony uses.
