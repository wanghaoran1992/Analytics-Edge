1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,240
In this video, we're going to explore our linear optimization

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:04,717
model further.

3
00:00:04,717 --> 00:00:07,050
We're going to use it to answer some "what if" questions

4
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:09,930
and to conduct some sensitivity analysis.

5
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:11,690
So here, we have a spreadsheet that

6
00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:13,890
is formatted very similarly to the spreadsheets

7
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:16,466
that we've used in Video 5 and Video 6.

8
00:00:16,466 --> 00:00:18,840
So we have the data up here, we have the price-per-click,

9
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:21,160
the click-through-rate, the average price per display,

10
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:23,640
the budgets, the query estimates.

11
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:25,314
Below those, we have the variables.

12
00:00:25,314 --> 00:00:26,730
So we have the cells corresponding

13
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:28,110
to the decision variables.

14
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:30,410
We have the cell corresponding to the objective.

15
00:00:30,410 --> 00:00:32,130
And to the right of these, we have

16
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:35,670
cells that contain the values of the decision variables

17
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:38,810
and a cell that contains the value of the revenue

18
00:00:38,810 --> 00:00:41,929
from our original solution from Video 5.

19
00:00:41,929 --> 00:00:44,470
So what we're going to do is, we're going to change our data,

20
00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:46,495
and we're going to see how the solution changes

21
00:00:46,495 --> 00:00:49,170
and how the objective value changes and compare it

22
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:51,130
to our original solution.

23
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:54,150
So as one of the questions that we might consider, let's

24
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:56,080
consider the following question.

25
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:59,390
What would happen if the click-through-rate of AT&T with

26
00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:04,100
query one increased from 0.10 to 0.5?

27
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:05,850
So to answer this question, let's crawl up

28
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:09,726
in the spreadsheet until we hit the click-through-rate.

29
00:01:09,726 --> 00:01:11,350
And let's change the click-through-rate

30
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:13,960
from 0.1 to 0.5.

31
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:15,870
Now, if we do this, you may have noticed

32
00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:19,000
that the average price per display for AT&T in query one

33
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
also changed.

34
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,470
So of course, this makes sense, because the average price

35
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:24,765
per display is just the click-through-rate multiplied

36
00:01:24,765 --> 00:01:26,210
by the price-per-click.

37
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:28,980
And here, the way we've set up the spreadsheet

38
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:31,410
is so that these cells are exactly

39
00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:34,490
the product of the corresponding cells.

40
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:36,920
So the cells that correspond to the click-through-rate

41
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:41,140
and the price-per-click for that respective query and advertiser

42
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:42,760
combination.

43
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:46,500
So our average price per display has changed appropriately.

44
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:49,960
And so now, we just scroll down until we see our variables

45
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:51,820
and we see our objective.

46
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:54,280
And let's click on Tools.

47
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,370
Let's open up the Solver.

48
00:01:56,370 --> 00:01:59,906
And we have the Solver configured the exact same way

49
00:01:59,906 --> 00:02:00,530
from last time.

50
00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:02,530
So we don't need to do anything here.

51
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:04,250
And so now, all we have to do is just

52
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:09,150
hit Solve and click on Keep Result, and voila.

53
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:11,290
We have a new solution.

54
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:13,540
So now, several things have changed with the solution,

55
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:15,390
if you can see.

56
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:18,980
So the first thing is that the allocations have changed.

57
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:23,970
So for instance, we allocate query one and AT&T 68 times.

58
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:27,950
So we decide to show AT&T's ad with query one 68 times,

59
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:29,700
as opposed to the original solution, where

60
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:31,630
we did it 40 times.

61
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:35,835
And we can also see that AT&T is never shown in query two

62
00:02:35,835 --> 00:02:38,040
or query three in our new solution,

63
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:41,030
whereas before, it was shown 40 times for query two and 80

64
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:43,550
times for query three.

65
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:46,980
Similarly, we show T-Mobile 72 times with query one,

66
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:49,720
whereas before, we only showed it 100 times.

67
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:52,107
And we also showed T-Mobile with query three

68
00:02:52,107 --> 00:02:55,600
14 times, whereas before, we didn't show it

69
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,300
at all with query three.

70
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:00,750
And Verizon's allocations say the same as before.

71
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:02,800
In terms of the revenue, our revenue

72
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:06,750
has gone up slightly from $428 in the original solution

73
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:09,890
to $430 in the new solution.

74
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:12,220
Now, this may seem like a small amount.

75
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:15,660
But actually, this is the most that we can hope to achieve.

76
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:17,770
And the reason for this is, if we scroll down,

77
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:20,860
if we look at our budgets, so the budget for AT&T

78
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:26,280
is 170, for T-Mobile, 100, and for Verizon, it's 160.

79
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:28,340
If we add up these values, you can

80
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:31,430
see that actually the sum of these values is 430.

81
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:33,220
Now, this isn't a coincidence.

82
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:35,240
In fact, if you think about it, this

83
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:39,650
makes sense, because what Google earns from each advertiser

84
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:42,440
is exactly how much that advertiser spends.

85
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:44,850
And if the most that each advertiser spends

86
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:47,710
is that advertiser's budget, then the most

87
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:50,000
that Google could hope to earn is in fact

88
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,600
the sum of these budgets.

89
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:54,850
So in fact, we are attaining the highest possible revenue

90
00:03:54,850 --> 00:03:58,540
that we can hope to attain in this case.

91
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:00,480
So that was rather interesting.

92
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:03,330
And now, let's change back the click-through-rate

93
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:06,860
from 0.5 back to the original value of 0.1.

94
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:08,860
And let's answer another question.

95
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:11,620
So the question that we'd now like to answer

96
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:14,910
is, what would happen if AT&T's budget increased

97
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:16,290
from 170 to 200?

98
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:19,829
So for example, AT&T calls us and tells us that actually they

99
00:04:19,829 --> 00:04:22,040
can afford more advertisements.

100
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:24,130
So how would that change our solution?

101
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:28,740
Well, in this case, let's just find AT&T's budget data.

102
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:31,260
So in this case, it is the cell here.

103
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:35,290
And let's change it from 170 to 200.

104
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:39,450
Now, let's scroll down to our variables and our objective.

105
00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:41,500
And let's just set them back to zero.

106
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:44,200


107
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,700
And now, let's go to Tools again, let's open up

108
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:52,460
the Solver, and let's hit Solve.

109
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:55,270
We get 428, which is actually the same objective

110
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:56,810
that we got from before.

111
00:04:56,810 --> 00:04:58,510
And let's just click on Keep Result

112
00:04:58,510 --> 00:05:01,790
and take a look at the solution.

113
00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:05,170
Now, interestingly, this new solution

114
00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:08,590
is actually exactly the same as the old solution.

115
00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:11,790
So what happened here?

116
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:14,640
Why didn't this change anything?

117
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:17,930
Well, actually, if you recall from the previous solution,

118
00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:19,600
in the previous solution, we actually

119
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:23,210
only used $168 of AT&T's budget.

120
00:05:23,210 --> 00:05:27,820
And in the previous solution, AT&T's budget was $170.

121
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:30,120
So in the previous solution, we didn't actually

122
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:32,740
use up all of AT&T's budget.

123
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:34,980
And since this constraint was not binding,

124
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:38,620
then increasing this constraint beyond 170--

125
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:42,100
so increasing the budget from 170 to 200--

126
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:45,290
won't actually have an effect on the solution.

127
00:05:45,290 --> 00:05:47,179
So this is why the solution didn't change.

128
00:05:47,179 --> 00:05:48,970
And in fact, in this case, we didn't really

129
00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:52,610
need to change the data and to solve the problem again,

130
00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:54,390
we could've deduced this from actually

131
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:57,110
looking at the budget values.

132
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:59,260
So these are examples of two questions

133
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:02,009
that we might consider in this setting.

134
00:06:02,009 --> 00:06:03,550
And so this concludes our exploration

135
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:06,190
of this problem in LibreOffice.

136
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:09,007
In the next video, we'll return to the slides,

137
00:06:09,007 --> 00:06:10,465
and we'll discuss some ways that we

138
00:06:10,465 --> 00:06:13,310
can extend the problem beyond the formulation

139
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:15,220
that we've been thinking about here.

140
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:18,080
And we'll also summarize what we've discussed so far.

141
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,660
So see you in PowerPoint.
