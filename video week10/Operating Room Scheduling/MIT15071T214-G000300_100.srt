0
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,720


1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:03,190
Here we are in LibreOffice, and you'll

2
00:00:03,190 --> 00:00:05,350
see that we have all the data we discussed

3
00:00:05,350 --> 00:00:09,450
in the previous videos loaded into the spreadsheet here.

4
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:11,710
Let's take a minute to familiarize ourselves

5
00:00:11,710 --> 00:00:14,240
with how the data is set up.

6
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:17,250
So here we see we've got the number of surgical teams

7
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:20,260
per department per day, and we've

8
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:24,140
got it listed by department-- all five of them are here--

9
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:26,820
and by day of the week-- Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday,

10
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:28,676
and Friday.

11
00:00:28,676 --> 00:00:30,050
Remember, for all departments, we

12
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:33,100
have the same number of teams in per day,

13
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:35,690
except for oral surgery, because the oral surgeon is

14
00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:37,855
only present on Tuesdays and Thursdays.

15
00:00:37,855 --> 00:00:40,760


16
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:44,030
Scrolling across, we see that for all five departments,

17
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:46,650
again, we've got the minimum number of operating rooms

18
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:49,630
that each one requires each day.

19
00:00:49,630 --> 00:00:52,470
This is simply 0.

20
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:54,670
As we keep going, we see the maximum number

21
00:00:54,670 --> 00:00:57,260
of operating rooms that each department requires each day.

22
00:00:57,260 --> 00:01:00,260


23
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:02,580
Going down to the next set of data,

24
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:05,620
we've got the weekly department requirements.

25
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:08,040
We've got the minimum and maximum number

26
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:12,570
of operating rooms that each department requires each week.

27
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:15,120
We also have the weekly targets.

28
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:18,140
This is data, because it is set by the departments

29
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:20,650
before the operating room manager has a chance

30
00:01:20,650 --> 00:01:24,210
to schedule the operating rooms.

31
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:26,269
So this is our problem data, and now let's

32
00:01:26,269 --> 00:01:27,685
go down to our decision variables.

33
00:01:27,685 --> 00:01:32,264


34
00:01:32,264 --> 00:01:34,180
All right, so here are our decision variables.

35
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:36,900


36
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:38,810
You see that we've set up a decision variable

37
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:41,770
for each department, and for each day of the week.

38
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:44,200
Right now, they're simply set to 0,

39
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:48,730
but we've colored them yellow, so they'll be easy to see.

40
00:01:48,730 --> 00:01:51,920
Let's now set up a column for weekly totals.

41
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:52,760
Let's put that here.

42
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:57,250


43
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:57,825
All right.

44
00:01:57,825 --> 00:02:01,820


45
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:03,360
So let's fill this in.

46
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,510
The weekly total for ophthalmology

47
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:09,610
should just be the sum of all of the number of operating

48
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:12,190
rooms assigned to ophthalmology from Monday through Friday,

49
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:13,820
so that's this entire row.

50
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:18,190


51
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:19,740
Just like that.

52
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:22,950
And we can drag this formula down for every department.

53
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:28,110


54
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:29,930
OK.

55
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:32,940
So now, if you actually go through each one of these,

56
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:35,450
you can see up in the Formula tab

57
00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:40,170
that we've got the formula for the weekly totals here.

58
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:42,750
So let's get started by putting in our objectives

59
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:45,000
and our constraints.

60
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,565
So down here, I've set up a box for the objective,

61
00:02:48,565 --> 00:02:51,810
but I haven't yet put in a formula for it.

62
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:56,230
So let's remind ourselves what the objective is here.

63
00:02:56,230 --> 00:03:00,170
The objective is to maximize the percent of target allocation

64
00:03:00,170 --> 00:03:05,040
hours that each department is actually allocated.

65
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,940
So how can we calculate that?

66
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:11,830
Our decision variables up here represent the number

67
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:14,040
of operating room hours that each department

68
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:17,850
is assigned on each day.

69
00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:20,290
We calculated the total over here,

70
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:22,410
as the number of operating rooms that a department

71
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:25,980
is assigned over the course of the week.

72
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:28,680
To turn that into hours, we need to multiply it by 8,

73
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:32,200
because operating rooms are staffed for eight hours.

74
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:35,482
So let's create a column that turns this into hours.

75
00:03:35,482 --> 00:03:38,680
We'll put it over here, and we'll call it weekly hours.

76
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:42,710


77
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:44,680
OK?

78
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:49,450
And this will just be equal to 8 times the weekly totals.

79
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:53,630


80
00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:54,590
Great.

81
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:56,749
And we'll do this for all departments.

82
00:03:56,749 --> 00:03:58,540
Here, this time I'll actually write it out.

83
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:05,800


84
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:06,300
OK.

85
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:18,870


86
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:21,000
Great.

87
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,090
So now we've got the weekly hours here,

88
00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:26,500
but to calculate what fraction of the weekly target,

89
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:29,370
we've got to divide it by the total weekly target.

90
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:32,140
And the total weekly target, we see, is up here.

91
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:34,690


92
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:39,140
So let's set this up for every department in a column

93
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:41,520
called "Percent of Target".

94
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:49,550


95
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:54,820
OK, so this will just be equal to the weekly number of hours,

96
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:58,400
divided by the weekly target.

97
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:01,630


98
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:04,600
OK, so we'll just set that up for each department.

99
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:21,560


100
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,740
Certainly there are faster ways of doing this,

101
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:27,550
but I don't want to speed ahead if you guys aren't yet

102
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:28,595
LibreOffice wizards.

103
00:05:28,595 --> 00:05:42,030


104
00:05:42,030 --> 00:05:42,530
OK.

105
00:05:42,530 --> 00:05:46,342


106
00:05:46,342 --> 00:05:47,800
All right, so we've got the percent

107
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:50,380
of target reached for every department.

108
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:54,020
So our objective-- we can go back to it now--

109
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:58,050
it'll just be the sum of all of these percent of targets.

110
00:05:58,050 --> 00:06:02,430
So let's add that in-- equals sum,

111
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:06,720
and then we'll add in all of these percent of targets.

112
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,696


113
00:06:09,696 --> 00:06:10,252
Great.

114
00:06:10,252 --> 00:06:12,710
So right now, of course, we haven't solved the problem yet,

115
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:16,080
so we've just got 0 in our objective.

116
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,990
But before we go ahead and solve it,

117
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:20,650
we need to add in our constraints.

118
00:06:20,650 --> 00:06:23,840
So down here in green, we have a list

119
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,480
of all the constraints we outlined

120
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:27,700
in the previous videos.

121
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:30,990
Let's review them quickly.

122
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:33,120
So the first one is just that the number

123
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:36,880
of operating rooms assigned each day is integer.

124
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:39,320
We can't assign ophthalmology 3/4

125
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:41,300
of an operating room on Thursday,

126
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:45,740
or general surgery 6.5 operating rooms on Monday.

127
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:49,450
We need to make sure that these take integer values.

128
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:52,060
The next constraint is just that the total number

129
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:57,130
of operating rooms each day has to be less than or equal to 10.

130
00:06:57,130 --> 00:06:58,790
So while we're here, let's just add

131
00:06:58,790 --> 00:07:00,960
in a line underneath our decision variables,

132
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,980
which calculates the total number of operating

133
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:04,990
rooms each day.

134
00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:07,470
Over here we'll call it total number

135
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:12,280
of operating rooms each day, and this will just take

136
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:18,670
the sum over all the operating rooms we assign on Monday.

137
00:07:18,670 --> 00:07:21,540
Just like that.

138
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:23,410
Great.

139
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:25,920
And let's drag this formula across

140
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,460
to use it for the entire week.

141
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:34,960


142
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,570
OK, so now we've got that set up,

143
00:07:36,570 --> 00:07:40,510
so we'll be able to do the second constraint.

144
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:44,200
The third set of constraints is the upper bound--

145
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:46,740
that is, the upper bound on the number of surgical teams

146
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:50,190
that are available each day.

147
00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:53,080
We also have an upper bound on the daily department operating

148
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:56,520
room requirement, and a lower bound on the daily department

149
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:59,180
operating room requirement.

150
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:02,320
Similarly, we have an upper bound and a lower bound

151
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:04,540
on the weekly department operating room requirements.

152
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:07,140


153
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:09,140
Our last set of constraints has to do

154
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:11,560
with departmental targets.

155
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:14,140
We want to make sure we don't give any department more

156
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:17,570
operating room hours than they actually want.

157
00:08:17,570 --> 00:08:19,090
So that means we want to make sure

158
00:08:19,090 --> 00:08:21,760
that the number of hours given to each department

159
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:23,660
is less than or equal to the targeted number

160
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:26,340
that they asked for.

161
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:29,190
All right, so let's go ahead and add these constraints

162
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:31,070
into the Solver.

163
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:33,730
So we'll start by putting our cursor

164
00:08:33,730 --> 00:08:38,450
on the objective function, and going up to the Tools menu.

165
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:39,690
And here we select Solver.

166
00:08:39,690 --> 00:08:42,650


167
00:08:42,650 --> 00:08:45,260
OK.

168
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:48,830
So because we started our cursor on the objective function cell,

169
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:52,750
it comes up properly with the "Target cell" already labeled.

170
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:57,110
We do want a maximum, so we keep that the way it is.

171
00:08:57,110 --> 00:08:59,720
And then here, where it says "By changing cells",

172
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:02,120
we put in our decision variables.

173
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:05,360
So we just select them all, like this.

174
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,530
All right.

175
00:09:06,530 --> 00:09:08,570
Now, before we start putting in our constraints,

176
00:09:08,570 --> 00:09:12,910
I want to remind you to go into Options,

177
00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:16,380
and you'll need to change this from DEPS Evolutionary

178
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:21,760
Algorithm to LibreOffice Linear Solver.

179
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:24,300
OK.

180
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:25,850
So you notice that the settings--

181
00:09:25,850 --> 00:09:29,700
you can choose to assume variables are integer,

182
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:32,780
and assume variables are non-negative.

183
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:34,640
We'll do that here.

184
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:37,510
In fact, this takes care of our first constraint, which

185
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:39,770
was to assume that the variables are integer.

186
00:09:39,770 --> 00:09:43,510


187
00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:45,770
OK.

188
00:09:45,770 --> 00:09:47,430
So we've got this set up.

189
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:51,410
Now let's put in the rest of our constraints.

190
00:09:51,410 --> 00:09:52,900
OK.

191
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:55,260
So we've already taken care of this first constraint,

192
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:57,430
that the daily number of operating rooms assigned

193
00:09:57,430 --> 00:10:01,084
is integer, and we've taken care of that with our options.

194
00:10:01,084 --> 00:10:02,500
So we'll go down to the next one--

195
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:06,850
the total number of operating rooms each day.

196
00:10:06,850 --> 00:10:10,960
Remember that we can't assign more than 10,

197
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:16,160
so we'll select this whole row, which

198
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,190
has the total number of operating rooms assigned

199
00:10:18,190 --> 00:10:22,460
each day, and we'll say that each element in this row

200
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:26,470
has to be less than or equal to 10.

201
00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:28,360
Great.

202
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:31,610
So on to the upper bound of surgical teams per day.

203
00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:37,091
Let's select our decision variables, all of them at once.

204
00:10:37,091 --> 00:10:37,590
OK.

205
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:41,165


206
00:10:41,165 --> 00:10:43,040
And then we'll need to scroll up to our data.

207
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:46,541


208
00:10:46,541 --> 00:10:47,040
OK.

209
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,964


210
00:10:49,964 --> 00:10:52,380
You'll notice here how I'm inputting all these constraints

211
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:52,970
all at once.

212
00:10:52,970 --> 00:10:56,710
We're actually putting in 25 different constraints, one

213
00:10:56,710 --> 00:10:59,357
for each day of the week, and one for each surgical team.

214
00:10:59,357 --> 00:11:01,440
And we're just putting them in with a single line,

215
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:04,620
by saying that all our decision variables need to be less than

216
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:07,285
or equal to this box of constraints.

217
00:11:07,285 --> 00:11:10,200


218
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:10,890
Just like that.

219
00:11:10,890 --> 00:11:14,243


220
00:11:14,243 --> 00:11:16,640
OK.

221
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,520
So our next set of constraints is

222
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:21,400
on the upper bound and lower bound of the daily department

223
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,815
OR requirements.

224
00:11:22,815 --> 00:11:25,680
So we'll put in our decision variables again.

225
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:26,705
Scroll down to those.

226
00:11:26,705 --> 00:11:33,920


227
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:36,560
And let's say that these are less than

228
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:41,000
or equal to-- sometimes we've got

229
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,160
to move the solver around-- the maximum number of ORs

230
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,335
per day per department.

231
00:11:45,335 --> 00:11:48,390


232
00:11:48,390 --> 00:11:49,530
OK.

233
00:11:49,530 --> 00:11:52,150
And we'll do that again for the lower-bound.

234
00:11:52,150 --> 00:12:00,880


235
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:03,410
This time we need to change the operator to greater than.

236
00:12:03,410 --> 00:12:10,900


237
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:22,230
Greater than the minimum number of operating rooms

238
00:12:22,230 --> 00:12:23,520
per department per day.

239
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:27,540


240
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:30,290
You see here that we've got 0's in for the minimum number

241
00:12:30,290 --> 00:12:33,880
of operating rooms per day, but you could conceivably

242
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:35,690
expect that one department might actually

243
00:12:35,690 --> 00:12:38,820
want a minimum number of operating rooms per day.

244
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:40,800
For example, general surgery, which

245
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:45,090
we see here has a weekly target of 189 hours,

246
00:12:45,090 --> 00:12:49,360
might actually want to have more than 0 operating rooms per day.

247
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:53,204
They might want to guarantee they've got at least one.

248
00:12:53,204 --> 00:12:55,820
We'll experiment with changing some of these numbers

249
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:58,090
after we solve the initial problem.

250
00:12:58,090 --> 00:13:01,280
For now, let's get our remaining constraints in.

251
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:04,040
The next ones we have are the weekly department

252
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:05,820
OR requirements-- the upper-bound

253
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:08,170
and the lower-bound.

254
00:13:08,170 --> 00:13:10,119
So let's just scroll down here in the solver

255
00:13:10,119 --> 00:13:11,535
to give ourselves a few more rows.

256
00:13:11,535 --> 00:13:16,090


257
00:13:16,090 --> 00:13:18,000
OK.

258
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,580
So here we'll put in our weekly totals.

259
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:24,420
Good thing we've already got this set up.

260
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:29,060
OK, so weekly totals-- this will have

261
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:31,860
to be less than the maximum required by any department

262
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:34,090
in a given week.

263
00:13:34,090 --> 00:13:38,410
So in the Value column, we go over here,

264
00:13:38,410 --> 00:13:41,310
and we put in the maximum required each week.

265
00:13:41,310 --> 00:13:44,620


266
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:49,740
We'll do the same for the lower-bound,

267
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:52,480
again, changing the operator to a greater-than or equal-to

268
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:52,980
sign.

269
00:13:52,980 --> 00:14:01,140


270
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:02,500
OK.

271
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:08,400
And we're on to our very last set of constraints, which

272
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:14,520
is the departmental targets down here.

273
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:17,120
So remember, we can't assign a department more hours than they

274
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,840
actually wanted to have, because operating-room time is

275
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:22,050
so expensive.

276
00:14:22,050 --> 00:14:23,850
So we'll select there the weekly number

277
00:14:23,850 --> 00:14:29,300
of hours, which we already have a column set up to calculate.

278
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:33,760
So we'll put this in here that the weekly number of hours

279
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:38,184
must be less than or equal to the target allocation hours.

280
00:14:38,184 --> 00:14:44,160
So scroll back up here to the target allocation hours.

281
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:49,710


282
00:14:49,710 --> 00:14:50,970
OK, great.

283
00:14:50,970 --> 00:14:52,690
Now we've got all our constraints in,

284
00:14:52,690 --> 00:14:54,720
and we're ready to go.

285
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:55,575
So let's hit Solve.

286
00:14:55,575 --> 00:14:59,690


287
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:06,510
It may take a few seconds-- up to 100.

288
00:15:06,510 --> 00:15:09,780
In the next video, we'll look at the results that we get,

289
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:11,120
and interpret them.

290
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:14,290
We'll also see how they change, if we experiment with changing

291
00:15:14,290 --> 00:15:16,880
some of the numbers in the problem.
