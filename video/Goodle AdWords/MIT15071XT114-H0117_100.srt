00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,190


1
00:00:01,190 --> 00:00:02,970
The process by which Google determines

2
00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:05,220
which ads to display for which queries

3
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:07,870
consists of three key steps.

4
00:00:07,870 --> 00:00:12,670
First, Google runs an auction where advertisers place bids

5
00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:16,329
for different queries that they want to display their ads on.

6
00:00:16,329 --> 00:00:20,260
Next, Google uses each bid in a metric known

7
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:23,220
as the Quality Score, which basically measures

8
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:25,980
how well a particular ad fits a particular query

9
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:29,060
to decide a quantity known as the price-per-click.

10
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:32,650
Google does this for each advertiser and each query.

11
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:37,070
Finally, and this is where optimization plays a key role,

12
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:42,080
Google decides how often to display each ad for each query.

13
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:44,120
This problem, as we'll see shortly,

14
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:47,427
can be formulated as a linear optimization model.

15
00:00:47,427 --> 00:00:49,010
Let's begin by thinking about the data

16
00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:50,530
that we need for this model.

17
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:54,090
In particular, let's think about the price-per-click.

18
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:56,490
So as we just discussed, Google decides

19
00:00:56,490 --> 00:00:59,000
each advertiser's price-per-click.

20
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,470
The price-per-click is how much each advertiser

21
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:06,800
pays Google when a user clicks on the ad for that query.

22
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:09,860
Each advertiser also specifies a budget.

23
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:11,340
This is the total amount of money

24
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:13,650
that the advertiser has available to pay

25
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:15,750
for all the clicks on their ad.

26
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:18,320
Every time a user clicks on the advertiser's ad,

27
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:21,410
the advertiser's budget is depleted by the price-per-click

28
00:01:21,410 --> 00:01:24,510
for that ad for that user's query.

29
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:27,410
Let's illustrate this with a small example.

30
00:01:27,410 --> 00:01:30,700
So suppose that we are Google, and three of the major wireless

31
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:35,700
service providers in the United States -- AT&T, T-Mobile,

32
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:39,030
and Verizon -- come to us wanting to place ads on three

33
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:45,190
different search queries: query 1, which is "4G LTE"; query 2,

34
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:48,330
which is the "largest LTE"; and query 3,

35
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:50,730
which is "best LTE network".

36
00:01:50,730 --> 00:01:52,510
If you're not familiar with these terms,

37
00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:55,900
4G and LTE basically refer to different standards

38
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:57,705
of high speed wireless data communication.

39
00:01:57,705 --> 00:02:01,650


40
00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:04,340
The table here shows the price-per-click

41
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:06,980
of each advertiser in each query.

42
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:09,970
So for example, this 10 here means

43
00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:14,430
that T-Mobile will pay Google $10

44
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:17,450
every time a user searches for query 1

45
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:20,700
and clicks on T-Mobile's advertisement.

46
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:24,380
In this example, T-Mobile's budget is $100.

47
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:27,102
If T-Mobile begins advertising and by some point

48
00:02:27,102 --> 00:02:28,810
five people have clicked on T-Mobile's ad

49
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:33,280
when they search for "4G LTE", then T-Mobile

50
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:41,290
will need to pay five times $10, or a total of $50.

51
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:44,150
If T-Mobile's budget is $100, this

52
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:50,660
means that T-Mobile is left with $100 minus $50,

53
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:52,045
for a remaining budget of $50.

54
00:02:52,045 --> 00:02:54,790


55
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:58,320
Now, while the price-per-click is important to know,

56
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:00,820
we must remember that the price-per-click is exactly

57
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:03,445
that, the price that the advertiser pays

58
00:03:03,445 --> 00:03:08,380
to Google for a single click of a given ad, on a given query.

59
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:13,840
This price is paid only if the user clicks on the ad.

60
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,880
But typically, the people who use Google search engine, who

61
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:19,110
are you and me, will not click on every ad

62
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:20,610
that is shown to them.

63
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:22,330
Therefore, we need a way to capture

64
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:25,030
how often users click on ads.

65
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:27,260
This is where the idea of click-through-rate

66
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:28,790
becomes useful.

67
00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:30,610
The click-through-rate is the probability

68
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:33,010
that a user clicks on an advertiser's ad for a given

69
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:34,010
query.

70
00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:37,160
You can also think of this as the average number of clicks

71
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:39,520
that we expect per user.

72
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,900
And this quantity is defined, as we said,

73
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:45,160
per advertiser and per query.

74
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:49,040
So to illustrate this, for the example that we just introduced

75
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,680
a few slides ago, suppose that we

76
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,230
have the following click-through-rates.

77
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:58,580
The number 0.08 here means that there is an 8% chance

78
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:02,310
that a user who searches for best LTE network

79
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:06,140
will click on AT&T's ad if it is shown to them.

80
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:08,910
In terms of the number of users who click on an ad for a given

81
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:14,410
query, this means that for 50 users,

82
00:04:14,410 --> 00:04:17,839
if the click-through-rate is 0.08,

83
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:23,580
we expect to see 4 users clicking on the ad.

84
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:27,060
Similarly, if there are a hundred users who

85
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:33,340
view the ad and 8% of them click on the ad,

86
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:36,040
we expect to see eight users clicking

87
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:38,360
on AT&T's ad for query 3.

88
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:40,900


89
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:43,360
In the next video, we'll define additional data

90
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,450
that we'll need to formulate the problem.

91
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:48,400
In particular, we will see how the click-through-rate

92
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,880
and the price-per-click can be combined together

93
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:54,880
to obtain a new quantity called the average price per display.

94
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:57,390
This derived quantity will form a crucial part

95
00:04:57,390 --> 00:05:00,200
of our linear optimization model.
