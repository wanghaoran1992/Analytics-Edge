1
00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:04,110
In this video, we'll discuss how radiation therapy can

2
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:07,310
be framed as an optimization problem.

3
00:00:07,310 --> 00:00:10,610
The data's collected in the treatment planning process,

4
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:13,980
which starts from a CT scan, like the one you see here,

5
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:15,690
on the right.

6
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:19,190
Using a CT scan, a radiation oncologist

7
00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:22,790
contours, or draws outlines around the tumor

8
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:25,260
and various critical structures.

9
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:27,310
In this image, the oncologist would

10
00:00:27,310 --> 00:00:30,780
contour structures like the parotid glands,

11
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:34,430
the largest of the saliva glands, and the brain.

12
00:00:34,430 --> 00:00:39,610


13
00:00:39,610 --> 00:00:42,360
Then, each structure is discretized

14
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:45,910
into voxels, or volume elements, which are typically

15
00:00:45,910 --> 00:00:48,770
four millimeters in dimension.

16
00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:52,630
The second image here shows a closer view of the brain.

17
00:00:52,630 --> 00:00:55,900
You can see the small squares, or voxels.

18
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:58,710
Here, they're two-dimensional, but in reality they

19
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:01,110
would be three-dimensional.

20
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:04,319
Now, we can compute how much dose each beamlet,

21
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:08,600
or piece of the beam, delivers to each voxel.

22
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:11,200
We'll start with a small example.

23
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:15,700
Suppose we have nine voxels and six beamlets.

24
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:19,110
Our voxels can be categorized into three types:

25
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:22,210
the tumor voxels, which are colored pink here;

26
00:01:22,210 --> 00:01:25,290
the spinal cord voxel, colored dark green;

27
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:28,890
and other healthy tissue voxels, colored light green.

28
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:33,600
So we have four tumor voxels, one spinal cord voxel,

29
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:37,010
and four other healthy tissue voxels.

30
00:01:37,010 --> 00:01:41,630
We have two beams that are each split into three beamlets.

31
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:46,610
Beam 1 is composed of beamlets 1, 2, and 3,

32
00:01:46,610 --> 00:01:48,800
and comes in from the right.

33
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:53,090
Beam 2 is composed of beamlets 4, 5, and 6,

34
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:55,400
and comes in from the top.

35
00:01:55,400 --> 00:02:00,170
Our objective is to minimize the total dose to healthy tissue,

36
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:05,060
both to the spinal cord and to the other healthy tissue.

37
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:07,410
We have two types of constraints.

38
00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:10,810
The first is that the dose to the tumor voxels

39
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:13,660
must be at least 7 Gray, which is

40
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:16,390
the unit of measure for radiation.

41
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:20,030
Our second constraint is that the dose to the spinal cord

42
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:23,420
voxel can't be more than 5 Gray, since we

43
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:28,080
want to be careful to protect the spinal cord.

44
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,520
We know the dose that each beamlet

45
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:34,180
gives to each voxel at unit intensity.

46
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:38,260
This table shows the dose that each beamlet in Beam 1

47
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:39,870
gives to the voxels.

48
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:42,350
Remember that this is at unit intensity.

49
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:44,850
If we double the intensity of the beamlet,

50
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:47,340
we double the doses.

51
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:49,480
The dose to each voxel can depend

52
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:53,290
on how far the beamlet has to travel, or the type of tissue

53
00:02:53,290 --> 00:02:56,660
that the beamlet has to travel through.

54
00:02:56,660 --> 00:03:00,440
Similarly, we know the dose that each beamlet in Beam 2

55
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:04,460
gives to each voxel, again at unit intensity.

56
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:06,890
The dose depends on the direction of the beam

57
00:03:06,890 --> 00:03:10,092
and what it travels through.

58
00:03:10,092 --> 00:03:12,050
Putting these tables together, we

59
00:03:12,050 --> 00:03:15,210
can write out our optimization problem.

60
00:03:15,210 --> 00:03:20,210
Our decision variables are the intensities of each beamlet.

61
00:03:20,210 --> 00:03:25,760
We'll call them x_1, the intensity for beamlet 1, x_2,

62
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:29,830
the intensity for beamlet 2, x_3,

63
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:32,880
the intensity for beamlet 3, etc.,

64
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:36,290
all the way up through x_6.

65
00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:39,550
As we mentioned before, our objective

66
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:44,860
is to minimize the total dose to the healthy tissue, including

67
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:46,600
the spinal cord.

68
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:50,660
So we want to minimize the total dose beamlet 1 gives to healthy

69
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:58,840
tissue, which is (1 + 2)*x_1, plus the total dose beamlet 2

70
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:04,880
gives to healthy tissue, which is (2 + 2.5)*x_2,

71
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:07,530
plus the total dose beamlet 3 gives to healthy tissue,

72
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:10,420
which is 2.5*x_3.

73
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:15,360
Now for beamlets 4, 5, and 6, beamlet 4 just gives one dose

74
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:21,330
to healthy tissue, beamlet 5, 2*x_5, and then beamlet 6,

75
00:04:21,330 --> 00:04:22,330
we have (1 + 2 + 1)*x_6.

76
00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:27,400


77
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,650
Now for our constraints.

78
00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:33,160
First, we need to make sure that each voxel of the tumor

79
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:35,960
gets a dose of at least 7.

80
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:39,560
Let's start with the first tumor voxel in the top row.

81
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:48,750
So 2*x_1 + x_5 needs to be greater than or equal to 7.

82
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:51,330
Now the tumor voxel in the second row,

83
00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:58,480
we have x_2 + 2*x_4, also greater than or equal to 7.

84
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:01,570
Now for the two tumor voxels in the bottom row,

85
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:07,610
we have 1.5*x_3 + x_4, greater than or equal to 7.

86
00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:13,680
And 1.5*x_3 + x_5, greater than or equal to 7.

87
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:18,900
Then for the spinal cord, we need to make sure that 2*x_2 +

88
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:23,460
2*x_5 is less than or equal to 5.

89
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:25,260
And lastly, we just need to make sure

90
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:28,303
that all of our decision variables are non-negative.

91
00:05:28,303 --> 00:05:32,620


92
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:36,150
So they should all be greater than or equal to 0.

93
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:39,040
Now that we've set up our optimization problem,

94
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:42,960
we'll solve it in LibreOffice in the next video.
