00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,900
Welcome to the linear optimization recitation.

2
00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:06,020
My name is Velibor, and I'll be guiding you through it.

3
00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:08,010
This week, we'll learn the core techniques

4
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:10,030
in applying linear optimization.

5
00:00:10,030 --> 00:00:12,272
We'll learn how to model a problem, how to solve it,

6
00:00:12,272 --> 00:00:14,480
how to compare the solution to alternative solutions,

7
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:18,680
and how to perform sensitivity analysis using the model.

8
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:21,140
The problem we will use to guide this whole process

9
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:23,580
will be the online advertising allocation problem

10
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:26,080
that is at the heart of Google's online advertising

11
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:28,611
system, which is also known as AdWords.

12
00:00:28,611 --> 00:00:30,860
Whenever you're ready, let's move on to the next video

13
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:32,640
and get started.
