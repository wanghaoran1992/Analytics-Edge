1
00:00:00,499 --> 00:00:03,020
In this recitation, we'll discuss operating room

2
00:00:03,020 --> 00:00:04,420
scheduling.

3
00:00:04,420 --> 00:00:08,510
That is, how hospitals can be made to run smoothly.

4
00:00:08,510 --> 00:00:12,030
In particular, we'll discuss how an operating room manager can

5
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:14,850
use integer optimization to make sure the hospital runs

6
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:16,790
smoothly.

7
00:00:16,790 --> 00:00:19,730
So hospitals have a limited number of operating rooms,

8
00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:21,290
or ORs.

9
00:00:21,290 --> 00:00:24,330
And operating room managers must determine a weekly schedule

10
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:28,040
assigning ORs to different departments in the hospital.

11
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:29,540
If you look on the right, you'll see

12
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:31,870
a picture of an operating room.

13
00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:35,360
You can see immediately how much specialized and fancy equipment

14
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:36,590
there is.

15
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:40,080
And you have to remember that for any surgery, staffing

16
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:42,790
the OR doesn't just involve the surgeon performing

17
00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:47,270
the surgery, but also other doctors, nurses, residents,

18
00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:47,980
and fellows.

19
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:51,490
There's usually an entire surgery team.

20
00:00:51,490 --> 00:00:54,540
So due to the specialized equipment in an OR,

21
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:57,200
as well as the specialized staff members,

22
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:59,910
it's been estimated that staffing an operating room

23
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:03,140
costs over $100 a minute.

24
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:05,600
Therefore, for a hospital to run on a budget,

25
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,050
it's very critical for the operating room manager

26
00:01:08,050 --> 00:01:11,340
to create a good schedule.

27
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:13,820
However, this isn't without difficulties.

28
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:16,860
Creating an acceptable schedule is a highly political process

29
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:18,890
within the hospital.

30
00:01:18,890 --> 00:01:22,220
Surgeons are frequently paid on a fee-for-service basis, which

31
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:25,380
means they get paid for every surgery they perform.

32
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:27,450
That means that when you change their allocated

33
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:30,210
number of operating room hours, it directly

34
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:32,300
affects their income.

35
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:35,240
Therefore, the operating room managers' proposed schedule

36
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:37,740
must strike a delicate balance between all

37
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:40,770
the surgical departments in the hospital.

38
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:42,740
However, there are many logistical issues

39
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:44,690
for the operating room manager to consider

40
00:01:44,690 --> 00:01:47,350
when designing the schedule.

41
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:51,140
Operating rooms are staffed in eight hour blocks.

42
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:53,380
Each department sets their own target number

43
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:57,810
of allocation hours, which may not be integer.

44
00:01:57,810 --> 00:01:59,340
In addition, departments may have

45
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:01,630
daily and weekly requirements.

46
00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:06,270
For example, gynecology might need at least one OR per day.

47
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:08,970


48
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:14,470
Ophthalmology might need at least two ORs per week.

49
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:16,230
And for example, the oral surgeon

50
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:21,180
might only be present on Tuesdays and Thursdays.

51
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:23,870
The operating room manager needs to take into account

52
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:25,550
all of these logistical issues when

53
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:26,875
designing a feasible schedule.

54
00:02:26,875 --> 00:02:29,990


55
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:32,750
In this recitation, we'll consider a case study

56
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:36,570
of Mount Sinai Hospital in Toronto.

57
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:40,140
There are 10 operating rooms at Mount Sinai, which

58
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:43,160
are staffed from Monday through Friday.

59
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:47,920
So 10 ORs times 5 days times 8 hours per day,

60
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:51,630
means that they have 400 hours to assign between five

61
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:54,350
different surgical departments.

62
00:02:54,350 --> 00:02:56,160
The departments they are assigning

63
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:02,860
are ophthalmology, gynecology, oral surgery, otolaryngology,

64
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:05,300
and general surgery.

65
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:07,100
Each of these departments has come up

66
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:10,740
with a weekly number of target allocation hours.

67
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:14,600
For example, ophthalmology requests 39.4 hours

68
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:19,180
of operating room time, and otolaryngology requests

69
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:24,850
26.3 hours of operating room time.

70
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:28,690
Now, it's very clear that just by looking at these numbers

71
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:30,950
they are not integer, and they are certainly not

72
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:33,400
multiples of eight hours.

73
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:37,090
This means that it's impossible for the operating room manager

74
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:41,160
to give any department exactly their weekly number of target

75
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:43,230
allocation hours.

76
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:45,340
However, the operating room manager

77
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:49,900
would like to try to give as many hours to each department

78
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:54,280
as possible up to their target allocation number.

79
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:58,800
We'll see how to solve this with integer optimization.

80
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:01,130
Let's consider the rest of the problem data.

81
00:04:01,130 --> 00:04:04,360
For example, we need to consider the number of surgery teams

82
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:07,360
from each department that is available each day.

83
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,940
We also need to consider the maximum number of operating

84
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:13,210
rooms required by each department each day.

85
00:04:13,210 --> 00:04:15,740
Frequently, these numbers are the same.

86
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:21,029
For example, ophthalmology requires at most two operating

87
00:04:21,029 --> 00:04:24,170
rooms every day.

88
00:04:24,170 --> 00:04:26,030
And we see that they have two surgery

89
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:29,630
teams available every day.

90
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:33,100
However, let's look at the case of oral surgery.

91
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:36,860
They require at most one operating room every day.

92
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:38,830
However, the oral surgeon is only

93
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:41,250
present on Tuesdays and Thursdays.

94
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:45,640


95
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:48,450
Additionally, each department has weekly requirements

96
00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:51,160
on the number of operating rooms they need.

97
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:55,690
For example, gynecology needs to have at least 12 operating

98
00:04:55,690 --> 00:04:58,475
rooms in a given week and at most 18.

99
00:04:58,475 --> 00:05:04,540


100
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:06,320
The traditional way of doing this

101
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:09,580
was not by using integer optimization.

102
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:11,680
Before integer optimization was implemented

103
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:15,470
at Mount Sinai in 1999, the operating room manager

104
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:17,740
used graph paper and a large eraser

105
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:20,930
to try to assign the operating room blocks.

106
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:22,770
Any changes that were necessary were

107
00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:26,050
incorporated by trial and error.

108
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:28,170
The operating room manager made a draft,

109
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:32,310
and this schedule was circulated to all of the surgical groups.

110
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:35,410
However, incorporating feedback from one department

111
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:38,230
usually meant altering another group's schedule leading

112
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:39,820
to many iterations of this process.

113
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:44,600


114
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:48,400
In the next video, we'll design an integer optimization

115
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,950
formulation for this problem.
