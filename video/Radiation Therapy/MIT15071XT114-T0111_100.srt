1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:04,630
In the previous video, we saw that the mandible, or jawbone,

2
00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:08,880
received the highest dose out of all of the critical structures.

3
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:12,690
The mean mandible dose was 11.3 gray.

4
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:15,040
So how can we reduce this?

5
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:18,970
One approach is to modify our objective function.

6
00:00:18,970 --> 00:00:21,760
Our current objective is to minimize

7
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:25,730
the sum of the total dose to each critical structure.

8
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:29,430
So we're minimizing the sum of the total dose to the brain,

9
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:31,990
plus the total dose to the brain stem,

10
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:35,040
plus a total dose to the spinal cord,

11
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,740
plus the total dose to the parotid glands,

12
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:40,570
plus the total dose to the mandible.

13
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:43,000
We could instead change our objective

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,650
to make the total dose to the mandible more important.

15
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:50,610
This can be done by weighting the term for the mandible.

16
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:53,720
By giving the mandible dose a weight of 10,

17
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:57,570
the total dose to the mandible becomes 10 times more important

18
00:00:57,570 --> 00:00:59,970
in our objective than the total dose

19
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:03,640
to the other critical structures.

20
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:06,740
If we solve our problem with this new objective,

21
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:09,650
we get the solution shown in this figure.

22
00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:13,730
The dose to the tumor, shown as the red line, does not change.

23
00:01:13,730 --> 00:01:17,410
It still stays within the constraints we've defined.

24
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:19,630
For each of the critical structures,

25
00:01:19,630 --> 00:01:21,760
the solution with the previous objective

26
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:24,860
is shown as a dotted line, and the new solution

27
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:28,330
with the weighted objective is shown as a solid line.

28
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:31,940
We can see that the dose to the mandible, shown in blue,

29
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:34,220
has significantly decreased by adding

30
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:36,130
a weight in the objective.

31
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:38,890
However, the dose to other critical structures

32
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:43,920
has increased, especially to the parotid glands, shown in black,

33
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,662
and to the spinal cord, shown in green.

34
00:01:47,662 --> 00:01:50,820
This shows how you can modify the objective

35
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:54,120
to capture different trade-offs that might be desirable

36
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:59,240
to different decision-makers or for different patients.

37
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:01,290
Another way to explore trade-offs

38
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:04,530
is to modify the constraints.

39
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:08,090
For example, by relaxing the mandible maximum dose

40
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:11,970
constraint or by allowing the maximum dose to the mandible

41
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:16,760
to be higher, we may improve our total healthy tissue dose.

42
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:19,750
We would like to know how much the objective changes

43
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:22,640
for different constraints.

44
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,930
This can be answered by looking at the shadow

45
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:27,320
prices of the constraints.

46
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:30,310
Recall that we have a constraint limiting the total dose

47
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:33,990
for each voxel in each critical structure.

48
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:38,730
This table shows the highest shadow price for any one voxel

49
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:41,150
in each critical structure.

50
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:45,940
The parotid glands and the brain stem have shadow prices of 0.

51
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:49,010
This means that we're not even giving the maximum amount

52
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:51,650
of radiation allowed to these structures,

53
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:55,450
so modifying the constraints is not beneficial.

54
00:02:55,450 --> 00:03:01,020
The spinal cord has a shadow price of 96.911.

55
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:04,140
This means that by increasing the radiation

56
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:07,470
to one voxel of the spinal cord by one unit,

57
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:09,710
we can decrease the total radiation

58
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:14,410
to other critical structures by 96.9 units.

59
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:21,400
The mandible has the highest shadow price of 7,399.72.

60
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:25,520
So if a slight increase in the mandible dose to a single voxel

61
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:30,210
is acceptable, the total healthy tissue dose can be reduced.

62
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:32,640
Keep in mind that this is the total reduction

63
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:36,180
across all voxels in the objective.

64
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:40,620
We've seen in this video that by modifying the formulation, both

65
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:42,610
the objective and the constraints,

66
00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:46,690
we can explore different trade-offs in our problem.
