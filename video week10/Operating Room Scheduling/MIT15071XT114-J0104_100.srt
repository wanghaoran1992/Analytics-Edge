0
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,210


1
00:00:01,210 --> 00:00:02,990
Okay, so solving successfully finished,

2
00:00:02,990 --> 00:00:04,990
and we've got the results.

3
00:00:04,990 --> 00:00:07,690
If you had any trouble solving this problem,

4
00:00:07,690 --> 00:00:11,280
then you should go into Options in the Solver

5
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,240
and select that you want to edit the length of solution time

6
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:18,480
and increase it past 100 seconds.

7
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:21,680
The LibreOffice Solver is not incredibly powerful,

8
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:24,550
so it may need more time to find the solution.

9
00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:27,120
We do recommend that if you have access to Excel,

10
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:30,590
that you use Excel instead for integer optimization problems,

11
00:00:30,590 --> 00:00:32,619
because Excel is a little bit better

12
00:00:32,619 --> 00:00:35,660
with integer optimization.

13
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:38,370
However, you probably got the solution just fine.

14
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:42,500
So you'll want to go ahead and click Keep Result.

15
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:45,980
So now, we can take a look at our solution.

16
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:49,470
So we've got the objective of 4.46.

17
00:00:49,470 --> 00:00:51,310
This is not particularly interpretable,

18
00:00:51,310 --> 00:00:54,596
until you remember that what our objective is,

19
00:00:54,596 --> 00:00:59,560
is the total of all departments percent of target allocation

20
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:01,570
hours reached.

21
00:01:01,570 --> 00:01:03,730
So the best possible number that we could get here

22
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:06,230
would be 5, if every department had

23
00:01:06,230 --> 00:01:11,020
100% of their target allocation hours reached.

24
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:13,017
So we've got 4.46.

25
00:01:13,017 --> 00:01:14,975
So let's go up and take a look at the solution.

26
00:01:14,975 --> 00:01:17,630


27
00:01:17,630 --> 00:01:20,690
So we're giving ophthalmology a total of four operating

28
00:01:20,690 --> 00:01:24,050
rooms per week, which is 32 weekly hours,

29
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:26,380
or 81% of their target.

30
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:29,420
We're giving gynecology 14, which

31
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:33,410
is 112 weekly hours, 95% of their target.

32
00:01:33,410 --> 00:01:36,050
We're giving oral surgery two, and as we see,

33
00:01:36,050 --> 00:01:38,240
the constraints restricted us so that we only

34
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:41,190
gave oral surgery operating rooms on Tuesdays

35
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:43,035
and Thursdays.

36
00:01:43,035 --> 00:01:44,890
This is 80% of the target.

37
00:01:44,890 --> 00:01:51,820


38
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:55,180
We gave otolaryngology three operating rooms

39
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:58,010
and general surgery 23 operating rooms,

40
00:01:58,010 --> 00:02:01,830
getting 91% and 97% of their target allocation hours.

41
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:04,570


42
00:02:04,570 --> 00:02:07,300
So suppose that you were the operating room manager, who

43
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:09,769
knows integer optimization.

44
00:02:09,769 --> 00:02:12,060
In practice, what would happen is that you would go off

45
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:13,490
and you would design what we just

46
00:02:13,490 --> 00:02:16,150
did here in the recitation.

47
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:17,760
You would have this optimization model

48
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,560
for operating room scheduling in the hospital.

49
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,490
You'd solve it.

50
00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:23,355
You'd find the optimal solution.

51
00:02:23,355 --> 00:02:27,800
And you'd come back and present it to the surgical departments.

52
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,560
And they'll look at the schedule.

53
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:31,580
And all of a sudden, they'll tell you

54
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:34,310
it doesn't work for them.

55
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:35,610
And you'll say, why not?

56
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:38,990
I incorporated everything that you asked for.

57
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:39,720
And it's true.

58
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:40,640
You did.

59
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:43,030
But oftentimes, there are actually other constraints

60
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:45,690
that they forgot to tell you about.

61
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:47,590
So what would you do in that case?

62
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:50,710
Well, you'd listen to their additional constraints

63
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:53,300
and go back and add them to the model.

64
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:55,970
So that's exactly what we'll do here.

65
00:02:55,970 --> 00:02:57,750
Suppose the general surgery department

66
00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:00,210
took a look at the schedule and said, "Oh, great, we

67
00:03:00,210 --> 00:03:03,580
have 23 operating rooms per week.

68
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:08,127
That's exactly two less than actually our maximum.

69
00:03:08,127 --> 00:03:10,210
It's right in between our minimum and our maximum.

70
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:12,280
And we're getting 97% of our weekly target.

71
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:13,920
We think that's wonderful.

72
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,070
However, it's a little bit uneven-- six

73
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:19,150
on Wednesday, three on Thursday.

74
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:23,830
Can we just have at least four per day?"

75
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:25,020
We can do that.

76
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:27,790
So let's go up to the minimum number

77
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:29,540
of operating rooms per day.

78
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:33,961
And for general surgery, let's change this from zero to four.

79
00:03:33,961 --> 00:03:35,960
This will help them balance throughout the week.

80
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:39,200


81
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:42,925
And potentially, ophthalmology will look at their schedule,

82
00:03:42,925 --> 00:03:44,300
and they'll think the same thing.

83
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:45,674
They'll think, "Well, we actually

84
00:03:45,674 --> 00:03:48,330
would prefer to balance it throughout the week.

85
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:51,280
We want at most one operating room per day.

86
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,100
We don't want to have two on Monday.

87
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:57,130
Let's put one of those on Thursday or Friday."

88
00:03:57,130 --> 00:03:57,770
So that's OK.

89
00:03:57,770 --> 00:03:59,720
We can do that too.

90
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:02,300
We just go to the maximum number of operating rooms per day.

91
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:04,680
And for ophthalmology, we change it to one.

92
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:09,470


93
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:13,710
Let's re-solve the model and see what we get.

94
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:16,860
Again, we select the objective.

95
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:20,040
Go to Tools, pull down the Solver.

96
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:22,432
It should have everything already loaded up,

97
00:04:22,432 --> 00:04:23,640
and we just get to hit Solve.

98
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:26,630


99
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:27,470
So that was quick.

100
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:29,600
Solving successfully finished.

101
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,180
And it looks like we actually have exactly the same results

102
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:34,180
as we had before.

103
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:38,290
Let's hit Keep Result and take a closer look at this.

104
00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:41,540
So our objective function stayed exactly the same.

105
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:44,380
But we were able to incorporate the new constraints,

106
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:47,270
the new requirement that the general surgery department have

107
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:49,930
at least four operating rooms per day,

108
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:52,190
and that the ophthalmology department have

109
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:55,670
at most one operating room per day.

110
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:57,880
This means that within the solution

111
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:01,770
we had before, there's actually a little bit of wiggle room.

112
00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:04,760
We could move some things around without changing

113
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:06,730
the optimality of the solution, that is,

114
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:08,880
without changing the percent of target

115
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:11,699
that each department received.

116
00:05:11,699 --> 00:05:13,240
And as you see, this is a little more

117
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:15,392
balanced for the ophthalmology department

118
00:05:15,392 --> 00:05:16,850
and the general surgery department.

119
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:19,970


120
00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:25,020
So great-- so maybe seeing that this was available,

121
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:27,140
then you'd go back, you'd present it,

122
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:31,580
and general surgery would say, well, maybe

123
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:34,660
could we have at least five per day?

124
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:36,840
So if you went up and changed this,

125
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:41,490
made it five all the way across instead of four

126
00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:48,270
and you solved it again, what would happen?

127
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:49,730
You probably have an idea already.

128
00:05:49,730 --> 00:05:53,549


129
00:05:53,549 --> 00:05:55,340
And this is exactly what you were thinking.

130
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:57,100
No solution was found.

131
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:58,390
The model is infeasible.

132
00:05:58,390 --> 00:06:00,560
Check limiting conditions.

133
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,750
So why is the model infeasible?

134
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:07,710
Well, let's take a look.

135
00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:08,540
Scroll back over.

136
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:11,210


137
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:15,060
The model is infeasible because, let's see--

138
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:17,130
so it's not because of the minimum

139
00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:20,850
and maximum weekly department requirements,

140
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:23,630
because general surgery said that they were willing to have

141
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:28,060
up to 25 operating rooms per week.

142
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:33,710
However, if you look at the weekly targets, 25 times 8

143
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:35,240
is 200.

144
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:39,450
So if we were to actually assign general surgery five operating

145
00:06:39,450 --> 00:06:41,190
rooms per day, we would be assigning

146
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:44,800
them 200 hours per week, which exceeds their weekly target.

147
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:47,420
And our optimization model says we cannot exceed the weekly

148
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:49,106
targets.

149
00:06:49,106 --> 00:06:50,855
So just right there, we can tell that it's

150
00:06:50,855 --> 00:06:53,370
infeasible because of this constraint.

151
00:06:53,370 --> 00:06:54,880
So let's change this back to four.

152
00:06:54,880 --> 00:07:00,630


153
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:03,390
So suppose you've come up with a solution,

154
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:05,860
you've gone back to the surgical departments,

155
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:08,670
you've presented your solution, they've maybe

156
00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:10,470
requested additional changes, and we've

157
00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:12,800
made those changes here.

158
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,810
So does this mean that your job is done?

159
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:18,980
Well, no, not really.

160
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:21,582
Of course, you could go back to the surgical departments

161
00:07:21,582 --> 00:07:23,540
and tell them that this is the schedule they're

162
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:25,580
going to have every week.

163
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:28,820
But I bet if did that, you'd hear some complaints.

164
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:33,330
Let's go into our solution and take a closer look to see why.

165
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:36,346
So for example, let's look at the ophthalmology department.

166
00:07:36,346 --> 00:07:38,990
In our solution, we're assigning them

167
00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:41,680
four operating rooms per week.

168
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:44,380
That gives them 32 weekly hours, which

169
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:49,250
is 81% of their target allocation hours.

170
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:54,310
If you assigned the schedule to ophthalmology every week, then

171
00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:56,310
they would never get more than 81%

172
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:58,220
of their target allocation hours.

173
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:02,090
And over time, this would lead to a real shortage.

174
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:04,810
The reason why we never assign them more than four

175
00:08:04,810 --> 00:08:08,130
in our optimization model is because their weekly target

176
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:11,740
number of hours was 39.4.

177
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:14,340
If we had assigned them five operating rooms,

178
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:16,830
it would be giving them 40 hours per week,

179
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:19,440
which exceeds their weekly target.

180
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,490
So the way our optimization model is set up,

181
00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:23,550
we will never give them more than four

182
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:26,610
operating rooms per week.

183
00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:29,410
But if you were the OR manager, you

184
00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:31,970
would realize that this is actually something

185
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:34,737
that we should be a little more flexible about.

186
00:08:34,737 --> 00:08:36,320
Perhaps you would consider giving them

187
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,760
five operating rooms one week, or maybe

188
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:44,110
five operating rooms every two weeks out of the month.

189
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:46,800
This is feasible because we have extra operating

190
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:52,510
rooms on Thursday and Friday, as you can see down here.

191
00:08:52,510 --> 00:08:56,370
Plus, it seems like it's a more efficient and fair solution.

192
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:59,140
Yes, although they do exceed their weekly target

193
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:04,000
by 0.6 hours, it means that on the weeks when they only

194
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:09,230
get to have 81% of their target allocation,

195
00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:10,950
they know that the next week, they'll

196
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:14,380
be able to make up for it.

197
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:16,427
So it seems like a more fair solution, as well as

198
00:09:16,427 --> 00:09:17,510
a more efficient solution.

199
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:20,670


200
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:23,490
By combining the power of integer optimization

201
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:27,130
with the understanding and flexibility of human judgment,

202
00:09:27,130 --> 00:09:29,641
you really get the best of both worlds.

203
00:09:29,641 --> 00:09:30,141
