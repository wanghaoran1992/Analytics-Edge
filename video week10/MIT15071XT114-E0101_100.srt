1
00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:03,550
In this lecture, we'll see how optimization

2
00:00:03,550 --> 00:00:06,700
can be used to construct sports schedules.

3
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:09,360
Specifically, we'll introduce the method

4
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:12,830
of integer optimization.

5
00:00:12,830 --> 00:00:16,710
Sports is a $300 billion industry.

6
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:19,500
This is twice as big as the automobile industry

7
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:23,030
and seven times as big as the movie industry.

8
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:26,810
This includes tickets for games, team merchandise,

9
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:29,620
salaries for players, etc.

10
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:32,330
Almost every single country participates

11
00:00:32,330 --> 00:00:34,380
in the sports industry.

12
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:37,620
For this industry to remain so large sports

13
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:39,990
teams are very important.

14
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:45,110
They key revenue for sports teams comes from TV networks.

15
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:49,840
TV networks paid $513 million per year

16
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:54,590
for English Premier League soccer, $766 million

17
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:59,170
per year for the National Basketball Association, or NBA,

18
00:00:59,170 --> 00:01:02,860
and $3 billion per year for the National Football League,

19
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:04,610
or NFL.

20
00:01:04,610 --> 00:01:07,730
These TV networks are paying such large amounts

21
00:01:07,730 --> 00:01:11,600
to ensure that they will have a good schedule of sports games

22
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:14,250
to convince fans to tune in and watch

23
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:17,570
the games on their network.

24
00:01:17,570 --> 00:01:21,100
In addition to the TV networks, good sports schedules

25
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:23,750
are important for other reasons too.

26
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:27,340
One is that extensive traveling, caused by a poor schedule,

27
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:32,190
can cause player fatigue, which can reflect badly on the team.

28
00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:35,370
Also, ticket sales tend to be better on the weekends,

29
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:37,450
so teams like to have games scheduled

30
00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:40,410
for weekends to increase revenue.

31
00:01:40,410 --> 00:01:43,460
Additionally, it's better to play division teams,

32
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:46,480
or direct competitors for playoff spots,

33
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:50,740
near the end of the season since teams have more information.

34
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:54,910
For these reasons and many more, everyone in the sports industry

35
00:01:54,910 --> 00:01:58,820
is incentivized to have a good schedule of games.

36
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:01,440
All competitive sports require schedules

37
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:07,100
defining which pairs of teams play each other and when.

38
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:09,860
Until recently, sports schedules were mostly

39
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:11,800
constructed by hand.

40
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:14,340
This is incredibly time consuming.

41
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:17,530
With just 10 teams, there are over one trillion

42
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:22,090
possible schedules, where every team plays every other team.

43
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:23,900
There are many constraints defined

44
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:28,630
by the TV networks, teams, cities, and others.

45
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:31,650
TV networks want games to occur at prime times,

46
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:33,090
like in the evening.

47
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:35,560
Teams want games on the weekends.

48
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,570
Cities want games that don't conflict

49
00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:40,970
with other major events, etc.

50
00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:44,510
This requires looking through all trillion possible schedules

51
00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:48,270
to find one that satisfies all of the constraints.

52
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:51,370
For major league baseball, a husband and wife team

53
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:54,960
constructed the schedules for 24 years.

54
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:57,360
They mostly built the schedule by hand

55
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:02,370
and used a giant wall of magnets to schedule 2,430 games

56
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:03,970
each year.

57
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:07,070
Not only is this approach time consuming,

58
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:10,610
but it's very difficult to add new constraints.

59
00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:14,220
If one new constraint is added that might make the schedule

60
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:19,170
infeasible and the process would have to start all over again.

61
00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:21,230
There have been many interesting constraints

62
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:24,280
that have been added by interesting people.

63
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:26,970
In 2008, the owners and TV networks

64
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:30,200
were not the only ones who cared about the schedule.

65
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:33,280
President Barack Obama and Senator John McCain

66
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,600
complained about the schedule.

67
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:38,800
2008 was an election year and President Obama

68
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:43,080
and Senator McCain were the leading presidential nominees.

69
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:46,430
The Democratic and Republican National Conventions

70
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:48,640
conflicted with the game scheduling

71
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:51,570
so the schedule had to be adjusted.

72
00:03:51,570 --> 00:03:55,450
After that was settled, the Pope complained about the schedule.

73
00:03:55,450 --> 00:03:59,470
The Pope visited New York on April 20, 2008.

74
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:03,270
He traditionally always holds mass in Yankee Stadium,

75
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:05,952
but a game was scheduled that same day.

76
00:04:05,952 --> 00:04:08,170
The schedule had to be readjusted

77
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:10,480
to move the Yankee game.

78
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:13,600
These are just a couple examples of the wide variety

79
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,820
of constraints that have to be accounted

80
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:20,000
for when building a sports schedule.

81
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,350
Recognizing how difficult it was to construct sports schedules

82
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:26,710
by hand, in 1996 a company called

83
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:29,320
the Sports Scheduling Group was started.

84
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:32,450
The founders were Doug Bureman, a former baseball vice

85
00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:37,130
president, and three academics-- George Nemhauser, Michael

86
00:04:37,130 --> 00:04:40,310
Trick, and Kelly Easton.

87
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:43,280
Instead of generating sports schedules by hand,

88
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,330
they use a computer.

89
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:49,130
They've been scheduling college sports since 1999

90
00:04:49,130 --> 00:04:52,560
and major league baseball since 2005.

91
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,820
They rely on optimization to build the schedules, which

92
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:59,560
can easily adapt when new constraints are added.

93
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:03,420
In this lecture, we'll introduce one of the techniques they use,

94
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:07,790
called integer optimization, to construct a sports schedule.

95
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:08,290
